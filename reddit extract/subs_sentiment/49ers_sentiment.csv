“That wasn’t the play,” McCaffrey explained.

McCaffrey was supposed to run a different route on a play on which he was what Juszczyk termed a “last-ditch outlet.” But he changed course mid-play when he recognized that he’d been dropped in coverage. As McCaffrey broke outside, freelancing, he raised both hands and Purdy moved off his primary reads. McCaffrey caught the pass at the 4-yard line and jogged into the end zone.” ",32375.0,positive

1oy9d7y,1763258124.0,457,0.88,112,,"Kyle Juszczyk should be the next 49ers GM Hear me out — Kyle Juszczyk is one of the most uniquely qualified players to transition straight into a front-office role, and the 49ers should seriously consider him as the eventual successor to John Lynch.

He’s been with the team since 2017 and has lived through every phase of the Kyle Shanahan era. Nobody understands the culture, standards, and roster-building philosophy better than someone who’s been in the locker room, on the field, and in the meeting rooms for nearly a decade.

He also brings rare versatility. He’s played fullback, tight end, running back, and even lined up at wide receiver when needed. That’s firsthand insight into multiple position groups, blocking schemes, route concepts, and how the offense functions at every level.

On top of the football IQ, he graduated from Harvard with an economics degree, not your typical player profile. He gets the analytical side, the negotiation side, the business side, and the long-term decision-making that front offices rely on.

With John Lynch eventually transitioning to a senior advisor role (or something similar), a succession plan that brings Juszczyk into the front office , whether as an assistant GM or director-level role first, could give the 49ers a seamless cultural and strategic continuation.

The guy checks almost every box for a future GM: leadership, intelligence, versatility, experience, and deep understanding of the 49ers’ identity.

1otvin7,1762822173.0,258,0.85,181,,"Hot Take: Purdy should ABSOLUTELY start when healthy! Why is this even being debated amongst talking heads on TV? Mac Jones has been very good filling in, but Purdy is much more mobile than Jones, who is basically a statue in the pocket, and Purdy doesn't miss wide open throws down field like Jones did to Robinson before halftime against LA. 

Jones is a check down artist and 90% of his throws are between the numbers and mostly to CMC and his pass completion percentage and yardage reflect that. Most of Jones passes don't go more than 5 yards and he consistently throws in front of the sticks on 3rd down leading to punts or 4th downs that we lose due to our inability to run and poor OL play. 

All these things were on display yesterday and with our depleted defense, we will lose in playoffs if we even make it there. Am I crazy?

Edit: To be clear, I am not saying Jones is bad. I'm just a dumb dumb who loves the team and the game. Injuries really sucked this year y'all. Thankfully our backup is competent and kept us floating so far this season.

Edit 2: Some of y'all need to improve reading comprehension. I said ""when healthy"", so saying ""his foot is broken"" or ""don't rush him back"" is really just fucking dumb as shit. And saying Purdy is worse because of last year, when this year half of Jones yards come from CMC is just dumb. Purdy didn't have CMC to check down to 9/10 plays like Jones actively does this year.

1otjcb6,1762794244.0,125,0.81,103,,"42-26 stung like hell, but this isn’t the end of our story, Faithful ❤️💛 I’m still processing yesterday. 42-26 at home to the Rams. That one’s gonna leave a bruise for a while.

Stafford went 28/37 for 339 and 3 TDs (zero picks). Kyren Williams averaged 5.9 ypc and punched in two scores. Our defense gave up 7.8 yards per play—worst single-game mark since Week 17 of 2020. Offensively we moved the ball (488 total yards, 31 first downs) but shot ourselves with three turnovers and 11 penalties. The math doesn’t lie: when you lose the turnover battle 3-0 and give up 42 points, you’re not winning many football games.
But here’s what the numbers also say:
•  We’re still 6-4.
•  We’re tied for the 7th-best point differential in the NFC (+38).
•  Brock Purdy’s 2025 EPA/play is still top-10 among QBs with 300+ dropbacks.
•  Our next three after the bye: Seahawks (who just lost to the Rams too), Packers (on a short week), Bears (bottom-5 offense). That’s a real chance to go 9-4 before December even hits.
This team has been counted out before. 2022 with Mr. Irrelevant? 2023 with no healthy QBs left? We don’t quit, we reload. Kyle’s staff will spend the bye week dissecting every snap of that Rams tape, and I trust they’ll make the adjustments—because they always do.
No “fire anybody” talk from me. These coaches and players are the same group that took us to two NFC Championships in three years. They’re hurting worse than we are right now, and they’ll use it as fuel.
So yeah, yesterday sucked. Let it hurt today. But tomorrow we turn the page. Levi’s will be rocking again soon, and when it does, we’ll remember why this fanbase is built different.
We don’t tear each other down when it’s dark—we hold the line together.
See you in two weeks, louder than ever.

2011:  2 muffed punts in NFCCG after miraculous 49ers/Saints game to lose to eventual SB champion Giants. heart break



2012:  Go into SB as a favorite with whispers about a dominant win possible.  Fall way behind, we're down and out.  Storm back, we have hope, 1st and Goal, TD wins it, everything goes wrong, Crabtree held in the endzone not called, heart break.



2013:  On the brink of beating The hated Seahawks, in NFCCG, Sherman snatches Crabtree's soul in the endzone for what would've been the game winner.  heart break.

  
2014-2016:  Everything falls apart.  49ers had the looks of a potential dynasty and the rug was pulled out from under us.  Everyone either gets hurt, retires or leaves.  The 49ers become a more relevant talking point on CNN and Fox News than ESPN and NFL Network.  We appeared to have it all, and it was taken away from us.

  
2017:  We get the hot shot young coach, Garoppolo comes over and 49ers go on a run to end the season.  Things looking up.  Young players to be excited about again.  

  
2018:  Injury bug hits early yet again.  Another lost season, but still a glimmer of hope for the future once we get healthy.  Bad record worth it to get 2 really good rookies in Bosa and Deebo.  

  
2019:  Everything clicks again.  49ers are the most talented team in the league.  Favorites throughout the year.  Steamrolled through the post-season.  Leading by double digits late with Chiefs facing 3rd and 15.  Leave Hill wide open for huge play, Bosa gets held many times, no calls.  Jimmy misses Sanders deep.  heart break.

  
2020:  Everybody gets hurt again.  Another lost season.

  
2021:  Overcome a slow start late in the season.  Make it to The NFCCG again, leading late.  Jaquiski Tartt drops a gift wrapped interception late.  Rams go down and score.  Momentum completely changes.  Rams go on to win SB.  

  
2022:  Trey goes down.  Jimmy goes down.  Brock is great!  Playing great on both sides of the ball.  Present and the Future looking bright.  Make it to NFCCG AGAIN!  Brock gets hurt after 3 throws.  Backup then also gets hurt.  Brock comes in to play QB despite not being able to throw the ball more than a couple yards.  Eagles stack the box and win easily.  heart break.  

  
2023:  Everything comes together.  49ers are favored in every single game of the season.  49ers dismantle Cowboys and Eagles.  49ers go from dominating everyone to pulling off playoff comebacks back to back weeks to make it to The Superbowl again.  49ers blow another 10 point lead to Chiefs.  49ers lead 3 separate times in the 4th Quarter and OT just to let KC come back again and again.  Things changed when Greenlaw injured himself just running onto the field, Kelce had been locked up until then.  THE WORST HEART BREAK SO FAR.

  
2024:  Despite heading into the season as betting favorites in some places or 2nd to Chiefs in others, an familiar repeat of 2020 and the last SB hangover.  Everything that could go wrong did.  How many teams in NFL history have had injuries to kickers in back to back weeks, and even had their punter sustain a season ending injury?  Everyone was either out or playing injured.  Our first round pick was shot in the chest.



2025:  Easiest schedule in decades based on last season's results.  Mostly healthy heading into the season, just waiting on Aiyuk and Mustapha to get back healthy.  Kittle scores a TD on first drive of the season.  That's the last we've seen of him.  Purdy, Pearsall and Jennings have all missed significant time.  Nick Bosa and The Defense was getting better, got a couple clutch plays late to seal wins.  Whoops, Bosa out for the season.  

  
At least we still have Fred Warner, edge rushers can be replaced, but you can't replace a 4x 1st Team All-Pro QB of the defense.  Mustapha is back now, Kittle coming back next week, CMC not hurt yet, HOPE!

  
Warner's foot is sideways.  Well, 49ers in 1st place in The NFL West, but the season feels over.  If the offense can remain somewhat healthy from here on out, expect a lot of 34-35 losses.  

  
Were The 49ers sacrificed to the sports Gods to bring 7 rings to Giants and Warriors?  Can't they just break our hearts early instead of building us up and giving us hope only to rip our hearts out again and again?  I'd rather be a Browns fan over the last 15 years, than to be a dozen plays or so going the other way to go from potentially winning up to 7 Super Bowls in 16 seasons, and when the dust clears, having NONE.",16194.0,negative

# The scoop on the Physically Unable to Perform (PUP) list and other key dates

Aiyuk's placement on PUP list: July 18, ahead of the 2025 NFL season.

Once placed on PUP list, he *must* sit out the team's first four regular season games.

* (Seattle, New Orleans, Arizona, and Jacksonville)

After Week 4, the Niners have a five-week window to decide if Aiyuk will begin practicing.

* (Los Angeles Rams, Tampa Bay, Atlanta, Houston, New York Giants)

Once Aiyuk starts practicing, the Niners have 21 days to activate him to the 53-man roster. To the best of my understanding: If he doesn't begin practicing with the team by October 31st, he must remain on PUP for the remainder of the 2025 season.

* Week 9, Nov. 2 away game vs New York Giants

☛ Trade Deadline: Nov. 4 at 4:00 p.m. ET.

* Week 10: Nov. 9 home game vs. LA Rams
* Week 11: Nov. 16 away game vs. Arizona Cardinals

☛ The latest Aiyuk could be activated to the 53-man roster for 2025

* Week 12: Nov. 24 home game vs Carolina Panthers
* Week 13: Nov. 30 away game vs. Cleveland Browns
* Week 14: **BYE**
* Week 15: Dec. 14 home game vs. Tennessee Titans
* Week 16: Dec. 22 away game vs. Indianapolis Colts
* Week 17: Dec. 28 home game vs. Chicago Bears
* Week 18: Jan. 4 home game vs. Seattle Seahawks
* Wild Card Round: Jan. 10
* Divisional Round: Jan. 17
* Conference Championship: Jan. 25

# Cons to Aiyuk returning late this season

* There will be rust after missing 10 weeks of 2024 regular season, 3 weeks of training camp, 3 weeks of preseason games, and \~11 weeks of 2025 regular season games.
* He risks a setback in his recovery, jeopardizing his ability to make major contributions during the 2026 season with the 49ers before a potential contract ""out"" in 2027.
* In scenarios where he is activated to the roster but isn't healthy enough to play, then roster space will be forfeited.

# Pros to Aiyuk returning late this season

* Aiyuk is a very talented WR that can help us win a Super Bowl. He knows the scheme, he's a hard worker, he blocks, he has great chemistry with Purdy, etc. etc. etc.
* He could be eased back into action if he is ruled out through our BYE week.

# What do you think?

Are we bringing Aiyuk back this season or are we not holding our breath? He could be back in time for the last 6 games of the regular season as well as the playoffs...",28236.0,neutral

Deebo was my fav player and I would wear his retro white jersey to Levi’s from 2019 until last season.  But it seemed like he disappeared in the Super Bowl because he couldn’t beat man coverage and short screens were well-defended.  It didn’t seem like he could break tackles anymore and would go down after initial contact.  I was bummed but I understood why the front office moved on from him after he requested a trade.  

I haven’t watched Washington games this year.  Is he actually getting open with honest route running and speed or is Kingsbury scheming him open?

“The San Francisco 49ers have somehow been able to pull off a 4-1 start, despite dealing with a number of injuries at wide receiver. But while the 49ers are looking under the NFL’s proverbial couch cushions for help at the position, castoff Deebo Samuel is having a remarkable bounce-back season in his new home with the Commanders.

Samuel continued his strong start to 2025 with his best game yet on Sunday, finishing with eight receptions for 96 yards and a late touchdown to seal Washington’s 27-10 win over the Chargers. That touchdown was his fourth of the season, matching the number of touchdowns Samuel tallied in his final year with the Niners.”",125646.0,neutral

Faithful was a derogatory term way before I was a fan. Maybe not derogatory, but at least a term used in jest to refer to the old heads before me, that had been fans since Kezar Stadium. Those guys took loses like champs and kept the faith that one day we would win ONE. Just ONE! 

They were the real Faithful!

I don't remember the 85 Super Bowl, I was 9 years old then. I just remember the energy amongst the adult males around me during the 86 season. It's what made me become a fan. Nothing but pride. 

I was 10 years old when I first got my heart broken by the NY Giants in the Divisional Round. Joe Montana was already a Super Bowl MVP in 82 and 85 and was larger than life! But that season he suffered a back injury early on and came back just in time for us to finish 10-5-1. This was under the great Bill Walsh. The short history didn't matter. The NY Giants broke my fucking heart. But I was a Niner none the less! 

In '87 we lost to the Vikings in the Divisional round, finishing 13-2, but we picked up Harris Barton in the draft which turned out to be a franchise pick. 

In 1988, we finished 10-6. 

What do you think happened after we finished 10-6? I'll tell you: We fucked up the Vikings 34-9 in the divisional, we fucked up Da Jim McMahon, Walter Payton (2.6yds), and Mike Ditka Bears 28-3, and we fucked up the Bengals in Super Bowl XXIII.

Yeah, that was the game when Ronnie Lott fucked up Ickey Woods, who was averaging 5.3 per carry. Old Ickey wanted to do the Ickey Shuffle (Google that shit) and Ronnie Lott met him in the line of scrimmage on a second down early in the first quarter. Changed the momentum of the game and Montana and Co. mounted The Drive! Google that shit too! 

Thursday's game felt like the Monday Night game on December 11th 1989 in Anaheim against the Los Angeles Rams. We closed the half at 17-0 Rams and went into the 4th quarter at 27-10. We won that game 30-27 and clinched the division, going on to repeat a Super Bowl Championship in January of 1990. 

I'm not saying that's what's happening here, but goddamn Mac Jones playing his ass off felt good. It was as good as Cool Joe getting blown up by the Cowboys in the playoffs, and Steve Young stumbling into the endzone against the Vikings.

He played his motherfucking ass off and as a Niner fan I can only stand behind him and cheer. He makes me proud to be a Niner. He makes me proud that HE is a Niner. 

I don't know what we're going to do against the Bucs. 

I fucking love watching Baker play, just as a football fan. 

But I'm gonna be there with my team and the rest of the Faithful. We're going to take our lumps win or lose. 

Until we win the next one. 

Then, we'll tell the kids we were here all along. ",7085.0,positive

In the title game, when devota smith goes down, still proceeds to throw 5 touchdowns against Ohio state.

I grew up watching fútbol with my family, but not American football. Throughout the years, I’ve tried and tried again to understand this sport, but I just can’t seem to grasp it. I love all other sports like basketball, baseball, track and field, water polo, and so much more. However, football has always eluded me.

The reason I chose to become a 49ers fan is because it’s an American sport. As a Mexican American, I want to embrace American football. I recently saw their latest ad, and it highlighted the importance of Latino culture to their team. That made me instantly feel included. (I’m not trying to steer into politics, but it was nice to hear.)

So, I’d really appreciate some tips about this sport. Who are some great players to look out for? What’s the 49ers’ rival? And so much more. I’m eager to learn what makes this team so special.

I hope you all can welcome me into your community and I’m excited to embark on this new sports journey. 
Thank you 🙏🏽

They’ve been playing their asses off and battling all season long despite some devastating injuries.   They’ve managed to win the type of games they found a way to lose all season long last year.   Last season left such a bad taste in my mouth for how they were losing games that this season has been a legit breath of fresh air for me.   I’m enjoying the season even though I feel they have no real chance at winning a Super Bowl (lord let me be wrong).   But after a brutal offseason where they lost alot of talent (was the right long term move letting most those guys walk) combined with some of the injuries they’ve had to top talent on the roster and still finding ways to win games.  They’re playing with house money.  I had no real expectations after Fred Warner went down, just play hard and maybe win some games off the schedule they have but they’ve been exceeding that.   

If they so happened to get hot and go on some unprecedented run.   I’m thinking 2005 Steelers, 2007 Giants, 2010 Packers, 2011 Giants or 2012 Ravens come to mind.   I would be absolutely elated.  Especially if they ended being on the good side of some of the crazy breaks like those teams were.      A lot of times when a team finally does break through, it’s not with the best version of themselves,  they’ll have an early exit with their most loaded team and finally pull through with a less powerful team.       If what they have left on defense can make some serious strides on defense and improve as a unit over these final 6 games.  There’s a shot to make noise if they make the playoffs.

The team clearly isn't great. They beat at bad team on the road by a lot.

^Last ^updated: ^2025-11-16_19:42:25.497484-05:00 Looking at today's game, I think Purdy showed why he deserves to be QB1 over Mac Jones. The offense was more vertical today than it's been all season. I think Mac makes more safe throws, but I don't think he's as much of a threat to stretch the defense. This helps take some pressure off the run game and the O-line.

Plus it helps that this is probably the healthiest the offense has been all season.",2242326.0,positive

>“If he takes a big step forward this week like he did last week, he should have a good chance to play,” Shanahan said.

>“It’s not a hard decision. It’s just more about Brock’s health,” Shanahan said. “It’s been awesome how Mac’s played. He’s been great. But we have a lot of confidence in Brock and we know he’ll play at a high level too, as long as he’s healthy.""

>Running back Christian McCaffrey said Purdy “looks like himself,” having worked with both the first string and scout team in recent weeks.

>“The biggest thing if you are coming back, which I think he mostly is, it’s just about every day getting better, because when you are back, it’s time to go,” McCaffrey said. “He hasn’t changed at all. He’s been a great teammate and leader as he always is.”

>Shanahan isn’t advising Purdy to stay within the pocket to protect his toe. “If that was the case, he wouldn’t come back. If you have to tell a guy to not be mobile and to stay out of situations, it’s hard to be successful,” Shanahan said. “A guy has to be able to react on the field and play.”",9863.0,neutral

^Last ^updated: ^2025-11-09_19:52:19.848232-05:00 These 3 TE formations were absolutely trashing us.  Obviously our defense is banged up to hell and we're missing Warner's leadership and experience but for the entire game we looked completely unable to adapt.  A handful of good plays do not a defense make when the rest of the game has been amateurish.

A defense as decimated as ours can only do so much.  Offense looked good, but just putting up points isn't enough, especially against an offense as capable as the Rams.",2359526.0,neutral

^Last ^updated: ^2025-11-09_19:52:19.848232-05:00 Outmatched, and outplayed.

It's just too much missing all the talent we're missing especially on D#. When the O# is forced to play at an almost perfect pace (and even gimps itself with a silly Fumble) to keep up, there's so much that can go wrong for anyone to overcome. I'm not pretending this game would have been a W with Mykel, Bosa, Warner, Matos out there (though maybe if they had been, we'd have also pursued a trade) but it's a different team.

The commentators said it well: the Rams O# is playing stellar right now, probably one of the best in the NFL, and they OL is solid as fuck, giving Stafford almost infinite time to place the ball where it needs to be. 

Refs didn't help, but this is what playing your 2nd and 3rd stringers, and dudes off the street will do to you when you're facing a healthy 1st stringer filled NFL team. 

I think mothballing Purdy would be wise at this point.. but I know that's an unpopular take.",429005.0,negative

^Last ^updated: ^2025-11-09_19:52:19.848232-05:00 Bottom line, the refs didn’t matter. The 49ers cannot stay healthy and we can’t expect 1/2 our team now starting back ups to win big games. 

We got the brakes beat off us plain and simple. So frustrating having one of the best rosters in the NFL be wasted by injuries again and again.",482630.0,negative

Live in Illinois and back when the Rams were in St Louis they held training camp at Western Illinois University.  My friend was a Rams fan so we would go watch practice sometimes.  After practice every Rams players would walk the line from the field to the locker room and sign a few autographs for the fans.  The exception would be Faulk who had a golf cart pick him up and drive the complete long way to avoid fans.  The one time I was there and he had to walk the line he was requesting $20 a person to sign anything.  A little 6 year old boy asked him to sign his football.  He grabbed the football and acted like he was going to sign it.  He then asked the kid for $20 and the kid told him he didn't have any money.  We all thought he was playing with the kid.

We had no intention on winning or losing this game.

It's an AFC team with an old 9ers coach.

The rest of the NFC West has the week off

Backwards pass to CMC in the 4th 🧐 🤔 

Were injured and this as a win would have done nothing for us due to injuries trying to play at 100%

Now the next 3 games are a different story, especially week 11 and 12 against the Rams and Cards.

To me it looked like we were playing to not get anymore injuries.

^Last ^updated: ^2025-10-26_16:33:18.560537-04:00 In retrospect, this was a bad matchup all around.


Houston has a good defense and DeMeco is very familiar with Shanny and Saleh.  This was primed for a beat down.


The defense needs some support.  Backups and 3rd stringers are only going to carry you so far.


Hopefully Brock is back next week. God bless Mac. He’s done great for a backup, but I think we’ve seen him hit his ceiling.",4429994.0,negative

^Last ^updated: ^2025-10-26_16:33:18.560537-04:00 Oh well, I ain’t mad at this performance… The boys battled their asses off with and the constant amount of players who keep getting hurt week to week. This team has a ton of heart which last year’s squad didn’t!

At some point when you got 3rd and 4th string and practice squad players making their season and career debuts. An one of the worst OLines in the league it’s gonna catch up with the team. Unfortunately the bye week isn’t till week 14 so back to the drawing board and let’s see if our guys can steal another W on the road.

Go 9ers!

Glad George got a TD on national TE day!!!

I absolutely believe this is because Salah is one of those guys who is just an incredible coordinator. There is nothing wrong with that. Simply what he has done through 7 games with this defense is spectacular. You can see it in the pmaher. You can also see it in him. The passion and joy.

^Last ^updated: ^2025-10-12_19:52:21.955876-04:00 You can only pull so many of these close games out of your hat with a team decimated with so many injuries. 

I was literally saying this morning, “At least we still have Fred to anchor the defense amongst all these injuries…” Shesh!

We had to play a flawless game to win, but the turning point was that Baker scramble on third and long. Mac played admirably but his limited mobility hurt us today. We were able to dodge it a bit but our team’s weaknesses from injuries are starting to catch up with us.   

We definitely need our guys back soon and Lynch NEEDS to make a deal for a big playmaker on the defensive side of the ball ASAP!

Imagine what this team would look like without the stellar kicker (Eddy) we have btw. 

But with all of what has happened this year, we’re still positioned nicely for a respectable playoff run!",16549770.0,negative

^Last ^updated: ^2025-10-12_19:52:21.955876-04:00 The Fred Warner injury is the last straw but….this is a team with serious issues. 

3.1 yards per carry on the ground so far this season. No, that’s not all because Kittle is out. The 49ers have averaged 4.5ypc in the Shanahan era, and 4.0ypc in that same timeframe without Kittle playing. 3.1ypc is a drastic drop. This team has no run game. 

The pass rush is lacking big time. With Bosa out the 49ers defense can’t consistently get pressure on the quarterback. 

Win or lose, 4-2, 6-0, or 0-6, a team that can’t run the ball and can’t rush the passer can’t compete against the best teams of the NFL. This is doubly true in January. 

This team had to contend with these two major issues before today even began - and now they’re dealing with that minus Fred Warner. 

Can’t run the ball. No identity on offense. Can’t rush the passer. Now missing your two best defensive players.

I’ve been optimistic so far this season but it’s starting to look bleak.",2878221.0,neutral

^Last ^updated: ^2025-10-12_19:52:21.955876-04:00 This was genuinely one of the worst O-line performances I’ve ever seen. Puni and Brendel were comically bad today 

They still don’t take building the O-line seriously. 

Why do I say that? They refuse to move off of Brendel and they actually extended and doubled down on RT.

# The scoop on the Physically Unable to Perform (PUP) list and other key dates

Aiyuk's placement on PUP list: July 18, ahead of the 2025 NFL season.

Once placed on PUP list, he *must* sit out the team's first four regular season games.

* (Seattle, New Orleans, Arizona, and Jacksonville)

After Week 4, the Niners have a five-week window to decide if Aiyuk will begin practicing.

* (Los Angeles Rams, Tampa Bay, Atlanta, Houston, New York Giants)

Once Aiyuk starts practicing, the Niners have 21 days to activate him to the 53-man roster. To the best of my understanding: If he doesn't begin practicing with the team by October 31st, he must remain on PUP for the remainder of the 2025 season.

# What do you think?

Are we bringing Aiyuk back this season or are we not holding our breath? He could be back in time for the last 6 games of the regular season as well as the playoffs... Honestly i think Aiyuk, if he gets healthy enough, will likely contribute to the offense, but it'll be 2024 Aiyuk, who everyone kind of hated. I think it'll be 2026 before he gets back to his peak ( if ever). 

TBH, the only person i'm expecting to drastically improve the offense is Kittle. Jennings is good but is working through injuries. Pearsall is improving but not on the level of the elite guys ( yet). Kittle may improve the blocking well enough to help CMC finally get going. 

In the end, the cupboard is pretty bare, but that's how its gonna be when you have to pay your ( deserved) QB1.",1016479.0,positive

Are we bringing Aiyuk back this season or are we not holding our breath? He could be back in time for the last 6 games of the regular season as well as the playoffs... Aiyuk won't be back to his pre knee injury self whatever that is going forward in his career probably until at the earliest 2026.

He'll return to the field sometime this 2025 season but I'd be shocked if he's nothing more than at best the #3 WR playing at 75%-80% of what he was before the injury.

Pearsall, Robinson, Jennings I honestly think will be ahead of Aiyuk on the WR depth chart along with WR snaps, targets, and receptions whenever Aiyuk does come back later this season.",423533.0,neutral

^Last ^updated: ^2025-10-03_00:10:30.882187-04:00 Locking down the entire sub after the first loss of the year is some of the softest head-in-sand crybaby shit I've ever seen from a sports sub. 

I've never complained about the mods here before, but this is straight up embarrassing for them. 

If the Cowboys or Seahawks pulled such a bitch move after losing one fucking game, we'd shit on them relentlessly and they'd 100% deserve it. 

I don't even know how they'll recover or spin this, which is funny, since I thought a couple mods were actually decent fans.",534256212.0,neutral

Day 15  I'm not even a Purdy defender but I swear y'all need to watch some breakdowns and understand the game better. The WRs are getting no fucking space, so Purdy is trying to overcompensate by making hero-ball throws he shouldn't be. But without that, we don't even move the ball at all in the air. Our run game sucks, our Oline sucks, our WRs miss their easy-peasy blocking assignments, and teams know it. Our WRs get no fucking separation.

Do ya'll think Tom Brady hasn't had games like this? Did you not watch the Rams SB where Brady had shit going for him until the very end? What exactly do you think a prime Brady does with: Bourne (was a FA 1 week into the fucking season), Moore (who's not an NFL caliber receiver), a banged up JJ, Pearsall (who is obviously fucking great against man), and our backup TEs? (Also CMC).

Six fucking drops and 2 tipped passes to INTs.

Obviously he threw some hospital passes but to call him Jimmy G is insanity. Jimmy G doesn't have 80 yards in this game, and most QBs lose this game as well. Jfc. Show me the plays, in context, where you think Jimmy does better than Brock. Go ahead, I'll wait.

If Bourne catches that one pass, or ST stops one fucking PR, are you still calling Brock Jimmy? No, even though he would have played the exact same.

^Last ^updated: ^2025-09-28_19:44:32.370001-04:00 Offense line just can't run block.  Kittle out is huge both in pass and run game.  Also in red zone too as they were 1/3 today.

Purdy with 3 bad turnovers but receivers also had like what 6 or 7 drops plus a fumble that gave them the ball at midfied.  Balls were high and I don't know if that's because he can't push off coming of the turf toe injury.

Special teams are back to being historically horrible again.

Long kickoff return at end of 1st half that led to FG.

Punt return TD immediately after a 3rd down Bourne drop where it looked had he caught it he could've kept running.

Stupid 15 yard personal foul on that last kickoff which could've led to a FG but kicker missed a makeable 47 yard FG.

But that's still 10 points.

Really can't blame the defense.  Were they perfect, no as they really couldn't put pressure on the QB, but they by far did a good enough job for the 49ers to win today.  They're going to need to make a trade.

That bull\*\*\*\* pass interference on the Stout INT was a momentum and game changer.  49ers would've had a 1st and goal.",113179840.0,negative

^Last ^updated: ^2025-09-28_19:44:32.370001-04:00 Yeah Purdy is gonna catch a lot of grief but this really was a Murphy's law type game. 

4th string TE fumbles. INT bounces off CMCs hands. Another INT tipped at the line. Strip sack from behind at the end... tough breaks. These games happen. 

A week 4 loss to an AFC Team to go 3-1 is one you can live with.",123032013.0,neutral

^Last ^updated: ^2025-09-28_19:44:32.370001-04:00 Definition of a team loss.

Defense shredded in the first half, line can’t block, Purdy turnovers and atrocious coaching.

Not to mention they still don’t prioritize kick coverage and gave up yet another punt return touchdown.

Sorry, Purdy deserves the criticism. It comes with the contract",52865318.0,neutral
