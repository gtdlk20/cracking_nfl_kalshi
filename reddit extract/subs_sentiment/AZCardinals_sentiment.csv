**NOBODY THINKS BRISSETT IS THE ANSWER** 

Jacoby just exposed the flaws in Kyler’s game. Kyler is more athlete than quarterback. He has zero chemistry with MHJ, couldn’t utilize Trey McBride in the red zone. 

In 4 games with JB, McBride has 5 TDs that ties his career TDs with Kyler in 3 years. 3 games with MHJ he has 2 TDs.

Kyler had more than a fair shake here, 7 years and two different coaching regimes. Kyler has a game that won’t age gracefully in the NFL. Because he’s undersized he relies on his athleticism and the injuries Keep piling up

Brissett comes in, plays solid, and suddenly there’s no rush to bring Kyler back. It just feels a little too convenient... like they’re using the injury as a clean excuse to sit him without calling it a benching.

Thought this was interesting as I was digging around PFR. Note that this is also team passing yards, not personal stats, as sack yards are counted against the team, not individual. Obviously it’s not the end all be all, as both these games were losses, but it does speak to some of the fluidity we saw in regard to the offensive output.

Additionally, it was the best 3rd down performance this season with 9/14 converted and Brisset posting an ANY/A of 8.56 against Kyler’s 2.56 on 3rd down for the season. Small sample size and most likely not sustainable, but it does seem to support that a large factor in these sustained drives was the conversion rate.

WTF do y’all want from this guy? Our OC needs to go. Our team needs to be healthy. We need more depth at a lot of key positions. I guarantee y’all will say the same shit about the next HC we get.

He has regressed his OLine as well. I don’t care if we lost the coach who made our line dominant. The buck stops with him when it comes to offense. He doesn’t adjust to the talent which all good coaches do he forces them to change to his offense. Basically trying to shove square pegs into round holes.

His other questionable stuff is how he handles the media and his communication to the fans through them. But tbh if we were winning it would be a complete non issue. It’s only being exasperated by the losing.",948789.0,negative

1opxmhy,1762444749.0,6120,0.93,84,Article,"Rob Gronkowski Doubts Kyler Murray’s Passion for Football, Expects QB to Leave Cardinals  To be fair, Gronk played with the guy who basically defined being a passionate student of the game. Brady had (still has) intense game film study habits. To the point that he has influenced younger QBs to mimic his habits. Simply put, very few QBs can compare to Brady's passion. Brady was also very vocal and a locker room leader from all reports from former teammates.

With Kyler...there's a reason they tried to sneak in that independent film study clause in his contract.

Kyler just isn't a student of the game, not many players are honestly. However, it's intensely magnified because NFL Quarterbacks have an expectation to be the guys who study and work on their game 24/7 like Brady, Manning, Brees, and even this generation of guys like Lamar and Mahomes as an example.

Look at someone like JaMarcus Russell and the story that always comes up regarding him is the blank tape story and his extremely poor study habits. Johnny Manziel was also quoted as saying he studied ""zero"" game film in the NFL.

With all that said, I don't think anyone should doubt that Kyler wants to win though just because he doesn't have that same passion. However, I do think Kyler will be another future case study of ""What if?"" because we all know he has the ability to be a great QB.",483786.0,negative

In the last few years, it’s become very apparent that Brady, Manning, Marino, Elway, even Carson Palmer would cuss you out if you dropped a pass or stopped short on a route. Marino was known for cussing out his linemen when he got sacked. It’s seems fucked up but that’s accountability. If the franchise quarterback doesn’t trust you, you won’t have a job. To me, on the outside, Kyler seems more like he isn’t vocal with these guys when they’re screwing up. Gannon (and Kliff for that matter) similarly unemotional.

I’d imagine it’s going to cost close to a first rounder for someone to take Kyler with his contract right? So probably just better to eat the dead cap and cut him. 

But he’s already tiny, constantly injured, outplayed by journeyman, and has his passion and leadership questioned. 

Baker, Jones and Darnold have all rebounded but I don’t think people questioned their leadership or passion. Guys kept going to bat for them in a way nobody does for Kyler. They were also much more plug and play QBs who have the prototypical size to fit most offenses. I just don’t know who is trading for that.

 This is honestly kind of shocking.  Not that they'd stick with Brissett, but rather wouldn't you at least pretend it was a game day decision to force the seahawks to prepare for both QBs?  Why are we offering up this information so early in the practice week for seattle?

Also, this is about as close to a confirmed benching for Kyler as you can get, as if this WAS health related, it would make no sense to determine this before seeing how Kyler was doing after another week of rest.  Mid foot sprains typically take 2-4 weeks to recover if mild, 4-6 weeks if moderate.  Kylers injury was on october 5th, meaning this week would be the 5th week since the injury.  Even for a moderate sprain he should be in the window where he could be ready to go any day now.  If it was a severe sprain then he wouldn't even be in practice working with the back ups, as those take multiple months of recovery.",3121050.0,positive

 I honestly won’t read too much into this.   You go with your hot hand, and if you’ve got a QB who’s big excelling point is he’s a god damned scrambling machine coming off injury you play the hot hand while playing it safe with the QB coming back. 

It could go either way long term, as we still have a year on K1 being heavy in guaranteed money, but it’s hard to read the long game here because of the combination.

 The fact that kyler is being made the scapegoat for this awful offensive output is ridiculous. Does brissett work better for petzing? Maybe. But kyler was not at all at fault for the horrible playcalling and wr and oline play. And the fact that this team thinks they can stick with petzing and try to replace kyler in the offseason with a young qb and have any hope of ever competing is insane.

 According to OptaStats, Kurt Warner (1999) is the only other quarterback in NFL history (since QB starts were tracked in 1950) to complete at least 65% of his throws, rack up at least 850 passing yards, register six passing touchdowns and score on the ground in his first three starts with a franchise.

He’s also hanging in and dealing despite taking 33 hits across three games. In doing so, he’s letting his reads progress and allowing more time for his pass catchers to get open.

It’s clearly showing up in the box score, with Marvin Harrison Jr., Trey McBride and Michael Wilson setting either season or career marks under Brissett’s direction.",201358.0,positive

Kyler Murray is making progress from his foot sprain, and could have a role Monday night, but Brissett will start. This season is spiraling into the worst-case scenario. If fans are growing impatient, I can only imagine the frustration within the organization. Kyler Murray’s NFL career has been plagued by injuries, poor coaching, and disappointing results. It seems as though Brissett could secure a victory and put an end to the Murray Era. However, some comments suggest that Murray is un-tradable, but that’s not entirely accurate. The Cardinals could take the dead money hit, and still move him by restructuring his remaining contract. Bottom line, he’s not going to be here next year as a backup with that contract, and it would be better to move him sooner vs later. ",418198.0,negative

1ob64hm,1760922031.0,2145,0.99,13,Meme / Art,"Mood  This might be the most disappointing season in a very long time, over a decade at least.

We have fielded bad teams in the past but this was extremely disappointing because of the expectations going into it. We had playoff aspirations this year. We started 2-0 and then have lost a bunch of ugly games in the same exact way - falling apart in the 4th quarter. It's as predictable as it is depressing.

And to top it off, we have clear problems with coaching without any clear options for anyone better to hire. So we are essentially in purgatory with no real way out. Yeah we need to fire Petzing - but who do we replace him with? Rallis, Ganon, their seat is burning hot but again, who is available to replace them?

On that note what is really tough is the fact that no good coach would want to come here. Why come to a losing team, with a weak roster, an owner that meddles in the daily operations and with an extremely high turnover of coaches? Kliff started strong and fizzled out with consecutive seasons getting worse and worse. Ganon has been doing the same.

I have to think this is largely an owner issue and Bidwill is never going to sell the team. Why would he when the stadium is always selling tickets? He doesn't care that those tickets sell to those of opposing teams. Which is yet another awful thing about this team, the number of transplants here means home games play like away games. These fans of opposing teams can't even let us suffer in peace they have to fill up our stadium and root against our team.

Elite OL, WR who get wide open a reliable RB as a safety valve and a defense that can erase his turnovers. Pretty much what Kyler had a OU.

The fact that Brissett looked good today in this offense, Murray has not come close to 300 yards this season in any game.

2021 was his best look, but he was surrounded by playmakers and his ceiling was an embarrassment of a performance in the wildcard.

If the play calling wasn’t as conservative as a 1950s middle school dance at a catholic school we might be 5-0 or 4-1, but I think that could just testimate to how the coaches view their QB. In reality you probably just reset on coaches and QB and start over.",203607.0,positive

I still don't think he is good enough to lead a team to the playoffs consistently. He hasn't progressed or learned to overcome his weaknesses and his strengths aren't big enough to motivate the things he struggles with. How the hell you're supposed to be a winning NFL QB when you can't thrown short over the middle (and every team in the league knows it) I have no idea. 

That said I fail to see how anyone can pick this season or that game on him. He played well enough to win. Hell he's played well enough to have us 4-1 at least. 

Kyler didn't fumble the ball out of the end zone. Kyler didn't mis snap the ball (at home with no crowd noise). Kyler didn't showboat after an int and fnle it into the end zone. Kyler didn't call 3 consecutive runs before the 2MW when a first down wins the game. Other than taking a sack and an intentional grounding he shouldn't have, I don't think he made a single bid mistake all day. And he ended up with very solid numbers and at least two great plays with his legs. 

Prior to this disaster, the other losses aren't on him either. Kyler can't both throw and catch balls. We have at least one loss that is due to multiple drops of catches that should have been made. Kyler can't tell the offensive coordinator what to call. Kyler can't make the O line remember how to block. Kyler can't be responsible for the lack of production in the run game. Kyler can't make the kickoff team land the ball in the zone (or be the braindead coach that didn't have them blast it out of the end zone). The mistakes that have lost us games have not been his. 

He's been the one decent performance on an otherwise miserable offense.

Neither species flies across the field and drops the biscuit before getting to the nest.",1376.0,neutral
