Great game, but what struck me was that the stadium was sold out and how many of those fans were wearing Rams gear. I know the joke is L.A. doesn't care about the NFL and opposing fans fill the stadium on game day, but it sure seemed like fans were at the game and getting into it. Maybe now that this year nine since their return they have built up support again, or maybe because the team has been pretty competitive since they returned, I'm not sure, but it feels like L.A. is starting to become a Rams town again.

Our defense kept them out of the end zone and their defense allowed 3 TDs. 

Their offense only scored 1 TD and our offense scored 3 TDS.

Our punter pinned them down on their own 1 yard line and their punter didn’t do shit.

That’s all 3 phases that were won by the Rams.

That being said, some have failed to replicate the Rams’ success in their own teams like Brandon Staley. If that’s the case, wouldn’t it be intriguing for a coordinator to remain on the team and get paid top dollar head coach money to stay as a DC while still building his reputation with a stable and a top-tier football culture? I honestly don’t know how the coaching staff money works so you can call me out on that.

1oo5siq,1762258731.0,102,0.98,25,,"Terrance Ferguson is Quietly Becoming a Key Weapon for This Offense I've been really impressed with rookie TE Terrance Ferguson over these last couple weeks. After dealing with injuries in training camp and preseason, he was flying under the radar, but he's starting to emerge as a legitimate playmaker for this Rams offense.

Look at his last two games:

* Week 7 @ JAX: 3 receptions, 31 yards, 1 TD
* Week 9 vs NO: 2 receptions, 54 yards

And his PFF grades have been trending up 85.2 overall last week, shows he's figuring it out.

What's getting me most excited is what he's doing on film:

As a receiver: He's making plays downfield. He's already shown he can beat safeties one-on-one on vertical routes and he's reliable in traffic.

As a run blocker: He's got this tenacity where he actually *wants* to put people in the dirt. It's not just going through the motions, he's driving defenders off the ball. Had a 77.2 PFF grade in the Jags game.

Lined up all over: H-back, slot receiver, traditional tight end position. McVay's using him everywhere, which means defenses can't scheme for him.

With Puka Nakua dealing with injuries, Ferguson could legitimately become a game-changer. He's got the skill set, the mentality, and the coaching staff clearly trusts him.

Inside the stadium I have to say the rams fans really did get loud for the team on scores and big plays, much better than the Jags fans despite being their home game.

Really really enjoyed the game, felt absolutely privileged to get to watch it and I hope the team gets more international games in the future.

I'm not watching Rams games (except for SF-LAR), but the numbers Matt's got seem insane from an outsider perspective, especially since the Rams are pretty much contenders in the NFC. All I'm saying is, he's got:

- 1684 passing yards (almost 300 ypg)
- 2 ints (tied for 2nd least interceptions thrown by a starter qb)
- 12 td (top 5 itl)
- 67% completion percentage 
- 4th best ratio of TD-INT

Like, these are insane numbers for a quarterback, especially one that has been in the league for so long, arguably being top 5, possibly being the second best quarterback in the league (though that might be somewhat of a reach), even with Puka, these numbers are crazy. But do they actually matter when in game?

  I’m old enough to have watched those OG guys. They were badass together but alas, never had a winning season.

1963-1966: The Rams did not have a great record in the four years the original ""Fearsome Foursome"" played together.

1967: Rosey Grier (ruptured Achilles tendon) was replaced by Roger Brown. The Rams finished the season with an 11-1-2 record under coach George Allen, which was the best they had during the ""Fearsome Foursome"" era and ranked first in the NFL in points allowed.

Because the Rams (if not each nfl team) would rather just pay focus groups and designers within this box of what’s commercially acceptable to a certain demographic. Plus they know they can stick with vanilla, boring and ugly designs because it costs less and they’ll make a ton of profit anyways , since a lot of fans just but anything that says “Rams” on it. 

Long-winded here but I’ve long had a bone to pick with the Rams lack of willingness to fully embrace the fact they are in LA, a fashion city and actually do something unique. 

I would buy non-licensed merch from guys on IG 10/10 times before I go to the official shop because of those reasons. 

This is personal taste to end my rant:
I enjoy the oversized shirts with graphics on the front&back, it’s a current trend for a lot of people. As a sports team in LA, why not create and sell the same thing? There’s a reason there’s a market for those items right now and they just refuse to follow trends.",80370.0,neutral

Obviously, I don't think the Rams fandom is at the same level as the Lakers or Dodgers yet, but I think the gap between them and those two franchises is closing.  We were never going to immediately win over a ton of adults with long-time allegiances to existing teams like the Raiders, 49ers, etc.   That's just not human nature. That was never the goal.

The goal is to win over the *next* generation of Angeleno football fans (and each subsequent generation going forward)....the kids.  Because I don't care how much his daddy loved the Raiders, little Johnny from L.A. is not going to keep sporting jerseys of his daddy's perennially 4-13 Raiders when his hometown Rams are winning Super Bowls and gaining national attention.  Loyalties are often developed in childhood, and current kids aren't going to have the same ""bond"" with franchises like the Raiders and 49ers like the previous generation of Angelenos did.  Especially if those teams suck.  Why would they rep a shitty non-local team (and the subsequent embarrassment) with no ties to their lives or where they're from?

Making the Rams ""L.A.'s team"" is going to eventually happen, but requires the previous generation(s) of Angelenos with other brand loyalties to die out (not to be morbid, but true) and the current young generation who grew up with the winning L.A. Rams taking over.  That will take a decade or so, but it will happen rest assured.  The old guard won't be around to rep other teams anymore.",1332349.0,positive

And the 49ers promote the booster clubs directly on their website.

49ers are directly supporting their “12 Man”.

Obviously, I don't think the Rams fandom is at the same level as the Lakers or Dodgers yet, but I think the gap between them and those two franchises is closing.  Give it another decade and it'll reach the level of a true hometown advantage. I grew up in LA (lived in SD the last 12 years), but in the 90s through the 00s there was just no local football at all. So you've got a whole generation of people like me in their late 20s/early 30s who just had nothing local to root for. I got into the Rams after they moved back and because one of my buddies is a diehard since St. Louis, and over the last 5 years I went from a casual watcher to a diehard that watches every game, highlight recaps the next day, and goes to 1-2 games a year. It hits you fast once you have a team to root for.  

In ten years you'll have a whole generation that reaches their teenage years/early 20s who could have been raised on the Rams being in LA their entire youth and that will supplement the fanbase big time. You'll still run into things like certain teams flooding the stadium for their one game every few years (that's just inevitable), but the home field advantage will continue to grow over time. I've been to the Seattle @ SOFI game each of the last three years and the number of Rams fans has just continued to grow per outing. 

Some more sustained success and just the passage of time will make LA eventually a real football town again. It's the same thing with the Dodgers who were a far second to the Lakers when I grew up, but new ownership and being a ridiculously successful team has led to them overtaking the Lakers locally in the last few years.",126890.0,positive

 That game was originally supposed to be played in Mexico but got moved back to the coliseum last minute because the stadiums field in Mexico was trashed by the soccer team. My father and I made a trip out of it to visit family and see the game, but when the game got moved we altered it so we got home on the day of the game and went straight from LAX to the game lol.

 I got so very lucky and had a coworker who had an extra ticket. Not only did I not have to pay, but the seats were awesome. We even had a private town car driver WITH beverages, who dropped us off and picked us up only a few blocks away from the stadium.

The game was unbelievable. The section we were in had all Rams fans and ONE KC fan who was not shy about rooting for his team. It was so much fun jabbing back and forth with this guy, all in jest, of course.

I only purchased one tall boy at halftime. Because the game was so tight and scoring was so frequent, I didn't want to miss any of the action to get another beer lol. 

The ONLY downside was the halftime show. It featured The Chainsmokers, who were popular at the time, but I thought they sucked.

As a HC, you need to rally support for your own coaches/staff while doing the same for your players, and hope that the org is willing to back you up. New hires go to fill vacancies because the money is difficult to pass up, no question. But as far a development goes, DCs/OCs already got that down. Under a HC like McVay, one might only need a year to really grasp what makes him so good, but to duplicate it elsewhere really depends on the top and how they support the HC. I know it’s often life changing money as a HC, but I can’t imagine coaching for turnstile spots like NYG/J and Raiders will give new HCs the support they need to succeed longterm.",11347.0,positive

I believe in this team and staff to get it done. Going to be a fun November! LFG!  Losing to either of the division rivals would be tough to recover from they way they're playing. Not winning the division obviously hurts our playoff seeding chances drastically And losing to the bucs would likely ""only"" make the path to the 1 or 2 seed difficult, but not impossible.


I trust the Niners less to keep their momentum going with so many big names out, but they've continuously kept winning so who knows.


Seattle looks seriously legit and Darnold honestly has a shot to lead his teams to 27 wins over 2 years between MIN and SEA. However his good friend and back field mate Jared Verse *will* have a major say in that.


If you absolutely have to lay out a blueprint and pick one game to lose, its the bucs because Baker, okay I can at least cheer for him in good conscience and if we beat the other two first, we would still lead the division after a loss to the bucs because of the head to head win against SEA. Then rally to finish the season and possibly fight for a top 2 seed.

 Yes. He’s just that good and sometimes floats under the radar because the last couple years he wasn’t dropping 45 TDs every year like some others. But if you watch him, you realize just how legitimate this dude is.",461511.0,positive

 I think the answer is “yes, but…”

Yes, he’s good. Really good. He’s also been a bit off in a couple of games, making really weird misses. And also, in this day and age, the fact that he’s not a very mobile QB is what keeps him from being at the absolute top echelon of QBs.

 He's been incredible, he just isn't a crazy throw / highlight kind of QB anymore. He's too old for that anymore, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. He always finds the right pass, has elite awareness of where exactly everyone is, and if his O-line is good enough on the day then he'll be able to still do those crazy no-look passes.

 Fuck the 9ers as a staff, record label and a crew, and if you down with the 9ers, fuck you too. You think they care about our injured players, or how it affects our seasons? Getting downvoted for kicking them when they are down, in a Rams sub is truly remarkable.

I know everyone has a “Sky is falling” mentality right now but the reality is that the offense is moving the ball extremely well in both the run and pass game right now.

Just one more:  Quit going for the home run on stretch plays on 3rd (and 4th) and short.

I know McVay REALLY wants one of these to hit, but he always is calling for Stafford to make a pinpoint throw (seam route, go route down the sideline, etc.) and hit a partially covered receiver in stride from 20+ yards away.  Obviously, Staff can (and does) easily do this, but it requires too much finesse and precision (and risk) for a play that simply needs to move the chains.  Quick slants or quick outs, Sean.
