He passed away years ago during the….Losman Era…so he never got to see the generation talent that is Josh Allen. 

When he was sick I would travel home every single Sunday , and we would watch the games together.  But it wasn’t until Thursday nights game that I had another memory come rushing back to me. When one of the players ultimately did something stupid on the field, my dad would yell:

1p3z1r2,1763832775.0,263,0.76,214,Discuss,"Rumors of the demise of the Bills OL are greatly exaggerated 
I’ve read a number of posts about how bad the Bills OL was on Thursday and that they gave Josh no time to throw.   And how the Bills OL now “sucks,” when in the past it was one of the best in the NFL.  The actual film shows something different.

The average time to throw is 3.2 seconds.  Josh had more than that on every one of the sacks he took.   Also Houston has the number one defense and probably the best overall pass rush from the DL.   Everyone knows your QB needs to get rid of the ball quickly versus a front that can rush like Houston.  

Don’t get me wrong, the OL had a bad night.  Some of these sacks were their fault.  Spencerport Brown should not have been in the game after his injury and was responsible for 2 alone. And Dion Dawkins false start on 3rd and 1 was an absolute killer.  

But to pretend that the 8 sacks were all on the OL just isn’t the case and that they are a crappy unit is just not accurate.  They had one of their worst games of the season, but coming into this game they were one of the best pass blocking units. 

So what’s the problem?

- WR not getting open and winning matchups 
- Brady not giving Josh answers
- OL losing 
- Josh just not seeing the field

Obviously it a mix of everything.  But I think there’s a huge gap between first two bullets and the last two bullets.  

What do you think?

But this to me is the turning point in our season, where we wake up from our offensive malaise. 

We will figure the offense out and in our next game against the Steelers will out on a show. 

Will do the same against the Bengals, but there our defensive backs will actually slow down their potent run game. 

The patriots we lost because of sloppy mistakes and penalties (we made those yesterday too), but we clean those up and win that game 31 - 24.

We overcome the potent browns defense by lessons learned against this Houston defense.

We shut down the Eagles offensively, with a potent offensive performance where Josh has yet another 6 td game. 

And finally we beat the jets of course.

We won’t win the division, as the patriots will handle their business.

But we make a run as a wildcard team and beat the Rams in a crazy Super Bowl, 49 - 42.

1p368ne,1763749510.0,122,0.95,40,Discuss,"Not many would've thought our safety tandem would look like arguably the strongest unit on the team in late November, but it is Jordan Poyer (78.5 PFF grade) who leads all Bills defensive players in Week 12 in what was a putrid offensive showing. Poyer is playing really well, so is Bishop.

  
Other interesting/notable grades:

Offense:

* Ty Johnson: 84.8 grade. Good game from him as a pass catcher.
* Jackson Hawes: 76.5 grade, second highest among Bills offensive players. One of the few bright spots for the offense this season. Will be a nice piece for years to come.
* Dion Dawkins: 64.0 grade. I think we all saw Dawkins give up on a few passing plays which is very disappointing. This grade is mostly supported by a 77.4 run blocking grade.
* Josh Allen: 55.6 grade. One of the lowest I've ever seen for him. Ran into a few sacks, threw a couple bad picks. He's just not seeing the field all that well this year for the most part, turning down some short gains that could help keep the offense on schedule, and I don't think he likes the playcalling either. Just a lot of issues compounding for this offense.
* Spencer Brown: 29.9 grade. Playing with one arm will do that for you. Appreciate the effort but he shouldn't have been out there.

  
Defense:

* Jordan Hancock: 75.9 grade. Second highest among Bills defenders. Only 12 snaps but he's shown some good things this year as well. I think him and Bishop have really benefited from Poyer being in that room.
* DaQuan Jones: 68.9 grade. He's the only DT giving us any kind of consistent play. Walker has been good for a rookie but he's just not ready to start yet imo. Injuries have forced our hand.
* Shaq Thompson: 67.5 grade. Been saying all year he's been our best LB.
* Cole Bishop: 67.4 grade. He has arrived, no question about it. 
* Larry Ogunjobi (40.7 grade), Jordan Phillips (36.6 grade), TJ Sanders (28.3 grade), all bottom 5. I know Sanders is playing mostly at defensive end but still, these guys aren't giving you ANYTHING. Phillips has been a bad run defender his entire career and now it's just laughable how often he gets blown off the ball and leave a massive gap for opposing RB's, Sanders looks like a bad pick so far and there were many better ways to utilize 8M than Ogubjobi.

He was throwing it late and over the middle for Ints against the Cheats. 

This game he took 4+ sacks where he could have just gunned the ball into the stands. Especially in the 2nd half when it was clear the O-line couldn’t stop the Texans D-Line. 

This play in particular is egregious. It is the Int. Why in the world is Josh deciding to throw into triple coverage instead of hit a wide open Cook OR a wide open Davis?

This is not coaching or play calling. This is a terrible rookie level decision making in a tight game. He wasn’t making these poor decisions the last few years. This season he is not seeing the field well and isn’t taking what the defense is giving us. He is forcing a lot of bad throws and that is on him. 

Hopefully this mini-bye gives him some time to regain his form and make better decisions. ",37136.0,negative

2 Targets on 28 Routes with 36 Snaps. But bith of these Targets could have been Game-Chaing-Plays. 

the First Catch was a beautiful Come-Back. Created Separation at the perfect Moment, more Separation than any other WR in our Core. 

The Second Target was a hell of a hard Catch for Gabe. I dont think any other WR of the Bills would get open like this at this play or has a fair Chance to catch the Ball. In this Moment it was close to some Inches. 

Even without getting targeted, Gabe showed some very goot Blocking, for example in the Lateral. 

I know Gabes Time here was up and Down the last Years. Going forward i think he is the best Outside WR on the Bills, depending the Coleman Situation.

I have been a bills fan all my life -- I had a lifesized Bruce Smith fathead in my childhood bedroom and  Lee Evans painted on my wall. Like many, I was a fan during the eras of JP Losman, Trent Edwards, Ej Manuel, etc. Growing up in Arizona, it felt like I was the sole bills fan in a 100 mile radius, having to defend my team vs the hordes of Chargers, Cowboys, and bandwagon Patriots fans that infected my hometown.

Now, we're 7-3 with an elite team that is about to make the playoffs again (knock on wood..) and yet, every fan I talk to is miserable. It has gotten to the point where my interactions with fans (online and in real life) are ruining the experience and joy of watching the team. People are always finding new complaints about players and coaches. Calling for firings, benchings, and just shitting on me if I try to point out any positive in our performance. 

I get that we've had some tough losses. I get we've come up short in the playoffs. But the world is not ending. Our championship window is still wide open, including this year. The goal is to win a superbowl and I have 100% faith the coaches and players are doing all they can to try to make that a reality. A single loss in any season, or three, or even five does not mean we are the worst team in the world. 

Sorry for the rant, but I just wish we could be a little happier about our team and celebrate our wins a little more. We're in the good ole days now, and I'd like to enjoy it. A decade or two from now, we'll be looking back and wishing that we had this team again. ",84905.0,negative

1ozo00x,1763403902.0,123,0.98,39,Discuss,"It is the big guys who top PFF's Week 11 grades for the Bills, as Spencer Brown (81.8 grade) and Deone Walker (84.6) lead all offensive and defensive players respectively. I'm a bit surprised by Walker, as it didn't feel like the interior defensive line played well against the run on Sunday, though it's always hard to really gauge IDL play on the live broadcast.

  
Other interesting/notable grades:

Offense:

* Tyrell Shavers: 79.5 grade. Amazing game from him. I genuinely think he might be an answer going forward for this team. He can actually create vertical separation to go along with his blocking. Excited to see him get these kinds of snaps next week too hopefully.
* Josh Allen 72.4 grade. Probably the most fun I've had watching Josh this season. Couple of mistakes that lower the grade but an amazing performance nonetheless.
* Gabe Davis: 70.4 grade. Happy for Gabe. This 4th WR role is where he can provide a ton of value for us. The Mack Hollins role.
* Curtis Samuel: 64.9 grade. Great blocking from him. Hopefully we can keep sprinkling him in going forward.

  
Defense:

* Dorian Williams: 82.5 grade. I LOVE the role McDermott and company have devised for Dorian this year. 3rd LB on run plays that allows him to play downhill, and spy on passing downs that once again allows him to make the most out of his athleticism. It's been a brillian wrinkle on defense this year to be honest and has made a big difference both against Tampa and KC.
* DaQuan Jones: 76.9 grade. Glad he's back healthy. 
* Cole Bishop: 73.2 grade. He's quietly now a top 15 safety in the league through 11 games for PFF. He has absolutely reached a completely new level in the last month. So excited for him moving forward.
* Christian Benford: 71.1 grade. His best grade of the season, hopefully a sign of things to come in what's been a disappointing season for Benford so far.
* Jordan Poyer: 69.5 grade. I just love Poyer. Bills legend.
* Terrel Bernard: 67.2 grade. I thought this was probably his best game of the season watching it live. He's been really bad most of the year and he's probably injured but good to see him making plays.
* Maxwell Hairston: 55.8 grade. Honestly didn't notice him much this game. He had a 28.7 run defense grade and 69.1 coverage grade. 
* Joey Bosa: 49.5 grade. I think this was probably his worst game of the season. I think the wrist is bothering him and I'd honestly sit him for a couple of games at some point. We need him to be as close to 100% as possible come Playoff time.
* Javon Solomon: 43.8 grade. Almost always part of the bottom 3 grades every week. Poor all-around, and now two weeks in a row with stupid penalties. I can't believe he has this kind of leash. Morgan Fox needs to take that role soon.",4822.0,neutral

1oyl9he,1763298373.0,121,0.9,74,Discuss,"On the talking point that Josh “picked” Keon With the rumors of Keon being a healthy scratch today, there’s of course been a lot of discussion about Keon’s role and his draft pick. One talking point that’s frequently brought up is that “well, Josh wanted / picked him”.

I’m not sure how exactly that idea started and circulated, but it’s a bit of a misrepresentation of the draft process from what we on the outside know, based on comments by Josh and Beane both. There’s more nuance to the situation, as evidenced by the quotes organized chronologically below.

Allen on the QB Room podcast, **pre-draft**:

> “Can I not like the guys that probably won’t be there? I think the top three guys, Malik Nabers, Rome Odunze and Marvin Harrison Jr., are three pretty great prospects. Then you get to that kind of secondish tier--if you will--of Bryan Thomas, Adonai Mitchell. I think Keon Coleman, Troy Franklin, Xavier Worthy are all there (and) Xavier Legette. To watch these guys at the combine, some fast, big, tall, heavy dudes. It was pretty impressive to watch.”

Beane on Sirius XM NFL Radio **after the draft**:

> “[Josh’s] been in the building the last couple of weeks now that the offseason program's started. So we did give him some guys, we said, 'Hey, sit back with the coaches, y'all watch them together and talk about how you'd use them. I'd like to hear what you see.' **And he liked a lot of the guys, he really did. But Keon was one -- I know he liked him a lot, too. And Josh and I didn't speak on Thursday, really. Maybe he stopped by that morning. But that next day, Friday morning, he FaceTimed me. Actually, I was still at home before I headed in here. And he was like, 'What are you thinking?' And I said, 'Well, barring somebody blowing me away, I'm going to take Keon.'** And he was pretty pumped."" (Emphasis mine)

It reads here pretty clearly that Josh wanted a receiver and watched a lot of them including but not limited to Keon; Beane and the rest of the front office presumably conferred and more or less settled on Keon, and *then informed* Josh of the pick.

Now, in defense of the idea that Josh picked him, Josh *did* go on to text Keon during the draft to say

>  “You're the guy I want. I watched a lot of receivers and I want to play with you""

To me, though, that reads as reaching out in encouragement as a teammate with the pick already being locked in.

**Some discussion points**
- How much input does or should a player have in the draft process?
- To what extent is it valuable or productive for offensive players to be close to or friends with the quarterback? Do we need more of an “adversary” / edge in the receiver room?
- **If** Keon is a healthy scratch today, what does that mean for him moving forward?",8168.0,neutral

I feel like fans who were really too young for the SB Era Bills, romanticize the players and coaches from the Drought Era.  By that, I mean they overrate them and pretend that they were better than they actually were.   The Drought Era was the lowest time to be a Bills fan and these players and coaches, were incredibly frustrating to watch.  

Case in point, this tweet from super fan Brother Bill.  I’m thinking he’s in his 30’s or so.  Chan Gailey was a super likeable guy, pretty good offensive mind, he did a lot of offense with limited talent.  And yes, talking to the press moments after he got fired was incredibly admirable.  But as a head coach he was 16-32 with the Bills.  The most games he ever won was 6!  Let’s not pretend he was some kind of genius.   Much more maligned coaches like Dick Jauron and Doug Marrone - even Rex Ryan - won more games that Chan.  

Also I find the narrative that “he coached the Bills when no one else would” to be a little rich.  There were plenty of coaches that would have taken that job.  Of course, everyone knew that the Bills were an ownership was a dumpster fire and it limited candidates.  But at the end of the day, there are only 32 openings each year.  Plenty of assistants would have jumped. The only ones who declined were the big fish like Cowher and Shanahan.  Also Chan was on his couch when they made him HC after getting fired from Georgia Tech.  So it’s not like he was giving up much. 

To be fair, it’s not just Chan.  People look back on players Fitz, Stevie Johnson, Sammy Watkins, EJ Manuel…even Doug Whaley in glowing terms.  I get that these players were underdogs, but these teams were brutal to watch as a Bills fan.  ",24204.0,negative

At face value this seems like a strong declaration from Sean McDermott of support to Joe Brady this past Sunday.  But we’ve heard this before.  Go back to 2023 when Ken Dorsey’s offense started out hot but then struggled to put up 20 points a game.  

After a pretty lackluster loss to the Bengals, the very next day, McDermott was asked point blank if he was considering moving on from Dorsey and he said: 

“No... I remain confident in Ken and our offensive staff.""

Sound familiar?  

Buffalo did win the next week (against Tampa) 24-18, but there were still plenty of missed opportunities on offense.  

Less than two weeks later, following the awful loss to the Broncos, Ken Dorsey was fired, with McDermott citing the need for ""change"" and ""consistent production.""

So now back to 2025…after the embarrassing loss to Miami, McDermott gave Joe Brady his full support and commitment for the remainder of the season.  Jay Skurski (who asks tough questions) brought up Brian Daboll to which McDermott said he is “not under any type of consideration"" at this point.  The key words being “at this point.”  

That’s why I think this is a fluid situation that could change.  McDermott showed us in 2023 that a public vote of confidence doesn’t mean much if things don’t improve on offense and losses start piling up. 

He will make a move midseason  if the team is not performing to his standard, regardless of what he said last week.

If the offensive struggles agin with the lack of open receivers and the long time to throw over the next 2 games, I think there’s a chance he moves on from Brady.   I say this because the game versus Houston is on TNF.  It would give whoever the OC replacement is a few extra days to prepare.  

For this to happen, I think he has to consider Daboll.  Because there’s not really a great option on his staff unless he wants to turn Rob Boras or Aaron Kromer who last called plays over a decade ago.  IMO the stakes are too high to go with a first time play caller.  So perhaps that will buy Brady more time than Dorsey?

And to anyone wondering, The 10-6 Baltimore Ravens fired their OC Cam Cameron for Jim Caldwell and won the Super Bowl in 2012 in December at 9-4.  They got their offense together just at the right time.  

Of course, if the offense gets it shizznit together this week and next, then all of this moot.  What do you think? Is this different, or is it just history repeating itself?",19671.0,neutral

My mother-in-law, Annie, has been the definition of a die-hard Bills fan for decades. She’s now in hospice with only a few weeks left after a long fight with pancreatic cancer. The Bills have been one of the few things keeping her spirits up- she literally schedules her life around games, her closet is mostly Bills gear, and she still lights up every time she talks about the team.

I reached out to Kevin Kearns (Bills Director of Comms) earlier today, but I’m not sure if that’s the right channel or if there are others in the org who handle situations like this. We’re not looking for anything big.... even a short message, note, or quick video hello from a player would mean the absolute world to her.

Thank you so much for reading, and for being the kind of community where I feel comfortable asking!

3.) 4th and 1. Josh has Shavers wide open for an easy first down. He backpedals and goes for the TD for Jackson Hawes.

4.) 2 options for quick hitters to gain positive yardage. Kincaid is breaking free behind the LB for a big chunk. Josh scrambles around and throws an incomplete pass.

5.) Stares directly at Curtis Samuel whose open for an easy completion in the middle. Has Shakir out wide as another option. Throws to the flat instead to Cook for a loss of 4 yards.

6.) Dolphins bring all out pressure but the line does a good job to give Josh a chance. Doesn't even look Keon's way who is 1on1 and breaking open on the quick slant. Tries to force a throw to Shavers and gets picked off in the redzone.

7.) TD pass to Hawes. Play worked out but again, Josh is scrambling and going out of structure when he doesn't need to. He has a clean pocket to work with. Keon is wide open on the sideline but he doesn't even look his way. Shakir breaks open in the middle (which is where he's looking). Josh leaves the pocket and finds Hawes for the TD so it worked out but there was plays to be made within the structure of the play.

Our $50million QB needs to be better. I don't know what he's seeing on some of these plays but it's like he doesn't trust anybody to make a play. He's too often trying to play hero ball and leaving the pocket when he doesn't have to. Concerning and he needs to get back on track and play like he did against the Chiefs.

1ouduh9,1762878242.0,211,0.95,132,Discuss,"Let's be a bit more specific about the coaching... and I'm not a doomer If we were on defense, and McDermott saw this type of alignment, he'd call timeout.  The play is doomed before it's played.  This is the difference between having an offensive head coach, or a defensive head coach.

Multiple things here.  We've run a play on second down that picks up enough yards that we think, let's take advantage of them being 'light', and run at them quickly.  But, Miami is ready for it.   Spencer Brown commented after the game that they were not prepared for this type of 'loading the box'. Miami knows we are running left with Cook.

It's not so much they've just overloaded that side, but they're in gaps that we really can't block the play well.  We've telegraphed that we have a run called, because we are hurrying to the line.

They must tell Allen he can't check out of this.  At first I thought the play clock must be winding down, and Allen doesn't have time to change the play, but look, there are 25 seconds on the playclock.

The other reason you call this off, the spot is different than the yardage.  The call upstairs is that we need 2 yards, when the spot is actually for three.

So, this play leads to a three and out.  Our advantage on this play is for Allen to pull the handoff, and go with the pass to the right.  Better yet is doing something that leverages the fact that no one is even over Spencer Brown.  Receivers block down, Brown pulls out to the right, let Allen keep it (sort of what Brown alludes to after the game... let Allen play).

EDIT: I should have explained this better.  When we rushed to the line, Miami was coached...they're running a tush push, line up tight.  They have a man on each side of the center's head, they don't do that the rest of the game.  Dawkins has to kick out on the linebacker, the left guard has to take the first down lineman to his left, the right guard is asked to do an impossible block... YES, you spend a timeout and get out of this.  If Allen has told them to get to the line and run this, most likely the snap is on first sound... so they are stuck in the play.  My point is an offensive coach calls timeout.  YES, spend the timeout.  Running this play is the equivalent of a turnover, because you're not getting the first down.",26660.0,neutral

I wanted to open this discussion as I think it’s important and essential to not ignore these issues any longer. People have continously defended and ridiculed others for speaking out. My mission here is to have this be an open discussion so we can suggest ideas/frustrations and just be real with what is happening with this team…

Our offensive scheme is uninspired, boring and just flat out not working. Is this a personnel issue? Possibly…I mean outside of Cook, Allen, Shakir and Kincaid. We have nothing to fall back on. If one or more is injured we are stuffed. The verdict isn’t out on Palmer yet. I truely think he is an important piece of this puzzle….But, Keon is struggling wether that be a scheming issue/confidence or any other issue. We need help… Our WRs barley seperate. It took Josh 20 seconds to finally find Curtis Samuel for a bail out play. This isn’t good enough for Josh. Yeah he made some stupid mistakes but I have never seen Josh so frustrated and defeated on a post game interview…he could barley make an comments for Keon and has to pause before saying anything. 

We are decimated on D. Not having epenesa hurt our run game and we were forced to have DaQuan in at Defensive end with Joey with an injured hand. We have big issues… Terrel does not look the same. And who knows when the next Milano injury is bound to happen. 

We can keep using injuries as an excuse but this has been a continuous issue that has plagued our team. We are just not adapting. How do we drop these games. How do we not shoot for a trade. How do we keep defending these schemes…it’s not good enough. 

That’s my 2 cents…

If I recall, Robert Woods had a breakout game and it went down the wire with Sherman mugging our WR’s on a pass play and not getting a penalty.  But I have no memory of this moment.  

Matt Carpenter gets destroyed by Sherman and the staff comes out to check on him.  Sherman is only given offsides and not a personal foul, and because of the injury, Carpenter was forced to leave the field for a play.  Fortunately there was :03 left, so Buffalo spiked the ball and stopped the clock with :01.  He makes the kick but Buffalo is called for delay of game.  So on the second try Carpenter misses!

So basically Seattle was rewarded for hitting the kicker.

I was watching the game last night and realized the whole “be loud” thing doesn’t really mess with kickers anymore. It just turns into one big wall of noise. What we need is something that actually throws them off for a second.

Here’s my idea: 

when the opposing kicker comes out for a field goal, the whole stadium goes quiet. Everyone starts doing a low, creepy humming noise. Total silence otherwise. 

Then, the second the ball is snapped, the entire place jumps up and yells BOO at once.

I think it would be fun to have a unique tradition for FGs in Buffalo and would be more likely to throw off the kicker. 

So curious to hear how everyone feels about this and if you have any other wild ideas to get in the kickers head.

Edit 1- how do we actually make this happen. I think it would be an awesome tradition and could only help us out.

In his live episode on Friday he answered several listener question about Sean McDermott’s job security.  Here’s a few excerpts of what he had to say.

Regarding the question of Sean McDermott will being fired this season:

“I think that conversation has been like going on outside, and certainly, I'm not immune to seeing what the fan base is talking about. And that has been somewhat of an undercurrent over the past several seasons, I would say. All I can say is this, like it's one thing to have that conversation, but it also has to be based in some sort of reality as to whether or not something is going to happen.

If they don't do what they want to do this year, which is get to the Super Bowl or win the Super Bowl. McDermott has just a lock on this job.

“I get your frustration. I understand the question. I just don't think that it's anywhere close to changing.

So I don't know what, you know, it's a very difficult conversation to even like have, because it's just probably not going to happen. Like 99%, 99.9% chance not going to happen”

He then answered a similar question and had this to say:

““It's... To me, it's not really worth like a heavy consideration when it just doesn't seem to be rooted in reality. So unless something dramatically changes and you hear me talking about it more to where, you know, maybe the tides are turning a little bit, I just, you know, I'm there every day.

I just can't see how that would ever be a consideration at this point in time.”

This is what I’ve always said when it comes to McDermott.  Fans can rant and complain and demand that his firing.  But it’s a waste of energy because it’s just not going to happen.   The full podcast is listed below

1oilat0,1761685162.0,202,0.95,163,Discuss,"Dan Orlovsky says the Bills safeties really suck; Josh hasn’t played well for 2-3 games. Dan normally has been high on the Bills over the past few seasons which is probably how he got his OBD gig.  This year you can kind of tell he doesn’t think as highly with this team.  While he doesn’t outright trash them he’s not very complimentary.  He also seems to be measured with words.  Almost like he’s thinking “how can I out this nicely without coming off like a jerk.”

Brownie tried to get him to say nice things about the Bills defense.  All he said was that their run fits were better and that Hairston moved well when he was in.   He also praised Hoecht after they promoted him.  

Dan then said that every offensive coordinator will be “hunting” the Bills safeties every play because they are hesitant.  

Offensively he said that Josh played poorly in the first half with reading the field, missing receivers and forcing the ball.  He think he is frustrated after playing poorly for 3 games straight.  He did praise the Bills offensive line, James Cook and surprisingly Reggie Gilliam!  

He then said that missing Josh Palmer is big and that the Bills don’t have anyone else who can consistently win on the outside and get open.  He assumes Beane will be active trying to trade for a 3rd WR.  (not exactly a ringing endorsement of Keon)

He then went on about how great Kansas City is and Brownie said he didn’t think they could win without 2 turnovers.  Dan did say you can move the ball on chunk plays on the Chiefs defense and that the Bills will need to win 32 to defeat top teams like Kansas City.  He also sees this as a “must win” to be considered a Super Bowl contender because he thinks they need home field due to communication on the road.   Seems kinda weird for an October game…

It’s not a knock on Dan.  I’d rather see him honest than sugar coat things the way Chris Brown does.  Just surprised to the difference with how he talked about the teams between this year and last.  ",31472.0,neutral

Meaning he knows the speed he has and he can catch. He's that CB that will bate the QB especially on short WR routes. The ones that end up in pick sixes. Like Deion played, he knows he has the speed to play off the WR far enough the QB thinks the WR is open. Not just short routes. He's a CB that can cover the field like a 2 deep safety. 

He will replace Tre White at CB opposite Benford for sure, once he's back in full game shape. I'm a Tennessee fan so watching a lot of SEC I've just seen a lot of tape of him. He really is special. I think late 1st round was a steal on this guy. Now he is an outside zone corner. He's not the best press man guy but if zone works it works. A good HC and DC will play him to those strengths even if everyone else on the field is in man. Just give him the quarter side of the field, ha.

1ohiodk,1761581572.0,195,0.98,27,Discuss,"James Cook's contract is looking like an absolute bargain, as he leads all Bills players in Week 8 with a 92.6 PFF grade. Cook is also now PFF's #1 RB through eight weeks. Other interesting/notable grades:

Offense:

* Connor McGovern 90.5 grade, second highest among Bills players in week 8.
* Khalil Shakir 88.4 grade, third highest among Bills players. Shakir seems to be the only WR that has any connection with Josh atm.
* Spencer Brown 83.7 grade. He continues to prove Beane right with that extension he gave him after his third year. He's a fundamental part of this offense and I was worried seeing him out there in garbage time (yes, I know they were running away from him thanks to Greg Olsen).
* Reggie Gilliam 73.2 grade. We're using him more and more in those big packages and he's definitely making an impact.
* Ray Davis 52.0 grade. Disappointing season from Ray so far. I think him cutting weight did him a disservice. He doesn't have the explosiveness or agility to be that type of back so he should just lean into the physical between the tackles runner he was in his rookie year.

  
Defense:

* Ed Oliver 84.8 grade to lead all Bills defenders. He's going to be a big loss the rest of the season.
* A.J. Epenesa 80.2 grade. We know he's good for one screen interception every year but even more than that I feel like this has been arguably his best season, very disruptive all around. Contract years are a thing.
* Greg Rousseau 80.0 grade. Just such a steady presence the last few years. I'm glad he's healthier now (bone bruise at the beginning of the year). 
* Maxwell Hairston 77.0 grade. The big one for all of us this week. Max had a great debut both in coverage and as a tackler. 
* Jordan Hancock 67.3 grade in 16 snaps. Really like that we're giving him real snaps now. He could be an answer at safety for years to come.
* Joey Bosa 61.8 grade. Tale as old as time: 80.3 pass rush grade and 50.9 run defense grade. 
* Michael Hoecht 57.5 grade. So this one surprised me a bit but he did get a 76.7 pass rush grade, the main issue is he got a 29.2 tackling grade so I guess he missed a couple of tackles.
* Jordan Poyer 52.3 grade. Not great but compared to Rapp's 44.6 grade for the season, it's an upgrade.
* Javon Solomon 27.9 grade, worst among all Bills players. He's been ineffective all year and I think he's the most likely cut candidate we have if we ever need a roster spot. With the tape he's shown this year I imagine he'll clear waivers and we'll have him back in the practice squad.

1octplq,1761092533.0,198,0.9,165,Discuss,"The Buffalo Bills thought they had it figured out, but Josh Allen still can’t do it all 

A pretty good article from from The Athletic (Tim Graham), about how losing back to back games this time feels different than previous seasons (Buffalo has lost two in a row each season since 2020).


These are the main points:


Offense:

After losing to the Patriots, Allen called it “sloppy” and “bad football” and “piss-poor.” Monday night (Atlanta), the Bills punted six times for only the eighth time since the 2019 postseason. They had three possessions to tie the score at 21 in the second half and gained 39 yards.

Complementary football:

Buffalo has held a lead for a whopping 2:47 in the past two games, all of it against New England and never once had the ball while ahead.

Pass protection: 

Allen was sacked 14 times last year. He has already been taken down 12 times, eight over the past three games. Pro Football Reference has charted Allen with a career-low 2.0 seconds of pocket time and 15 scrambles (rushes on plays designed to be a pass), which would put him on pace for 71 this season. His career high was 57 scrambles in 2022.

Discipline:

The Bills have committed 35 penalties, 30 of them accepted for 209 yards. They drew 15 flags against the Patriots and four in the first quarter alone versus the Falcons, including a Gregory Rousseau offside that erased a takeaway and a Tre’Davious White pass interference on a third-down incompletion to extend a touchdown drive. Opponents have accepted at least eight penalties in three straight games, something the Bills haven’t experienced in four years.

Turnover margin:

The one trend everybody knew Buffalo couldn’t count on forever was its kooky 25 consecutive games without a negative turnover margin. Buffalo was a minus-4 combined against New England and Atlanta.

Run defense:

Despite amassing 26 tackles for losses on runs, fourth most in the NFL, they’ve allowed 5.8 yards per carry, with 3.9 yards after contact, both league worsts. Only the Tennessee Titans, who fired their head coach this week, have allowed more than the Bills’ nine rushing TDs.

Open-field tackling:

At safety, Sports Info Solutions has Taylor Rapp down for seven missed or broken tackles and Cole Bishop for three, most comically on Bijan Robinson’s 81-yard touchdown run Monday night. Also, 34-year-old Jordan Poyer is on the field again.

Buffalo’s secondary:

First-round draft choice Maxwell Hairston might be back from his training camp knee injury soon. The blazing cornerback provides no guarantees, having not played an NFL down even in the preseason.
On the 15 balls thrown into White’s coverage, he has allowed 11 receptions (73.3 percent) for 114 yards and a touchdown, while also committing pass interference twice, defensive holding twice and missing four tackles. And he missed a game.
Christian Benford has surrendered an even higher passer rating, 18 of 28 attempts (64.3 percent) for 174 yards and four touchdowns with a pass interference, a defensive hold and an illegal contact

Wide Receivers:

Coleman has been invisible at times and did something off-field to make McDermott bench him for the first series of the New England loss. Coleman fumbled away his first catch in that game, at Buffalo’s 10-yard line, gifting New England a free field goal in a three-point game.
The next day, McDermott acknowledged Coleman “has shown growth this year.” If that’s the case, then how truly immature was the player they drafted 33rd overall? McDermott last year benched Coleman for the first quarter of his third NFL game. Twenty-three games are too soon to declare anything, but Coleman already has a grimacing reputation to shake. Veteran receivers Curtis Samuel and Elijah Moore have been healthy scratches already. Newcomer Joshua Palmer hasn’t clicked so far, and now he’s hurt.
So are Kincaid and eleventy-three others. McDermott, as was the case with Ken Dorsey and Brian Daboll before, has shown frustrations with offensive coordinator Joe Brady for being “too cute” and not using Cook enough — the same Cook who scored 18 touchdowns last year but Beane was reluctant to extend and who some daffy fans weren’t too worried about replacing with, say, Frank Gore Jr.

Beane:

Beane was so cocksure Allen’s solo act would work again that the GM made only minor moves to improve the offense. Beane even seemed willing to let running back James Cook walk in 2026.
In a post-draft interview on the Bills’ flagship radio station WGR 550-AM, Beane lashed out at the hosts for criticizing his lack of attention to wide receiver throughout the offseason. The club thought Beane was righteous and entertaining enough to feature his rant — that the Bills even had to bleep — at the very beginning of their behind-the-scenes draft special. The Bills didn’t lead with material about the rookies they drafted; they wanted to ridicule.
Through six games, the receiver criticism looks legitimate. The highest draft picks haven’t made an impact, and receiver production has been negligible.
Almost a year ago to the day, with concerns over the wideouts and the Bills coming off back-to-back losses, Beane traded for Amari Cooper, and although the five-time Pro Bowl receiver didn’t light up the stat sheet, his presence was credited for opening up the offense.
To make a similar deal now, of course, would require Beane to admit he was wrong this offseason.
As much as fans are losing patience with Beane, his job is not on the line — not as long as Terry Pegula, who also owns the pitiful Buffalo Sabres, maintains peace of mind that at least one of his teams has competent leadership.


The Bills might not lose consecutive games again this year. They should win more games than they lose. The playoffs are nearly assured.
Buffalo probably will pull out of this funk, but what then? In their roles, Beane and McDermott own the highest regular-season winning percentages in club history by a lot — and there’s the rub.
The regular-season victories will keep coming and they will keep thinking they’ve got it all figured out.
Historically, that’s what this Buffalo Bills era has been good at.

If youbhave Bills gear, or a Bills tattoo, I am approaching you and casually saying ""Go Bills."" Here are the results:

Monday - Magic Kingdom - 3/3 - 100% and a nice conversation with a guy that ended with a classic FTP

Tuesday - EPCOT - 2/5 - 40%. A lot of fraudulent fans???? A low-light was when when a guy responded to GB with a ""huh??"" I followed up with a reliable ""where else would you rather be??"" And got a ""uhh ok"" and he walked away. Guy was not with a family and had a division champs shirt from 2024.

So through 2 quarters, we are 5/8 = 62.5% . This is not how we prove we are a great fan base. Last year this same test resulted in a score over 90%

Tomorrow we gotta pick it up people!!!

UPDATE:

Like a down field strike to John Brown in the 3rd quarter, we started cooking on day 3 in Animal Kingdom and EPCOT!!!

GB count : 4/4 at AK including a security guard and waitress at Yak and Yeti.. and then 5/5 at EPCOT. I definitely schemed up one of my most diehard looks with chicken wing hat and dated mafia TTP shirts.

Through 3 days we are up to 14/17 = 82% im hoping for a strong day today at Hollywood Studios to get us up over 87%.

1ob216p,1760910122.0,182,0.77,106,Discuss,"The downfall of Mike McDaniel’s Dolphins started in Buffalo October 1, 2023

The Miami Dolphins were undefeated and averaging a blistering 43 points per game. They had just obliterated the Denver Broncos 70-20, even passing up the chance to break the single-game scoring record.

The talking heads on ESPN (Dan Orlavsky pops in my mind) declared Miami’s offense “unstoppable” and “revolutionary.” Dolphins fans were already discussing MVP, Coach of the Year, and yes… a Super Bowl (finally!). The man at the helm was an unconventional wunderkind, Mike McDaniel, hailed as an offensive genius. The Dolphins themselves were sharing the thinking emoji on social media…a smug, modern retort of ""how about them Dolphins!""

And then the Buffalo Bills happened.

Rather than the game being a changing of the guard, Miami was exposed by Bills coach Sean McDermott. He seemed to have written the blueprint on how to defend the Mike McDaniel offense: Play two-high safeties, take away the first read, pressure the immobile Tua (who had recently gained 20+ pounds to protect from injury), and play physical on both sides of the ball. It was a 48-20 laugher.  The key, McDermott seemed to realize, was that while Miami was incredibly fast and athletic, if you played them very physical they weren't going to punch back. Much like the jock who stuffed the meek nerd into a locker in a 1980s comedy, McDermott exposed the limits of McDaniel’s “genius.”

The best part of the win, was the photo of Josh ironically mocking the famous thinking emoji from earlier in the week.  

That season, Miami continued to beat up on less-talented teams, but every time they played a quality opponent, their foe borrowed the same blueprint to slow down the offense and then some. 

The team once predicted to win the Super Bowl ended up getting eliminated in a brutal cold-weather game because they were, quite simply… too soft.
In subsequent seasons, McDaniel tried to counter by developing an innovative running and short passing game. He saw some success, but his offensive line really had no nasty “dudes” and neither did the defense.  They needed Richie Incognito’s and instead got Larry Borom’s.  Moreover, this style of football neutered the big-play potential the offense once had.

So when you look back at the high point of the Mike McDaniel as head coach, just know the downfall started on that warm October day in Buffalo.

How about those Dolphins?” We have the answer - they were the same as the old Dolphins.  ",14995.0,positive

I’ve been a lifelong bills fan (23 years).

If you don’t know anything about cards, or don’t care about them, feel free to share any stories! My dad was at the first 2 of the 4 super bowls in 90 and 91 (he tells tales of the soul crushing wide right) I recently found his card collection consisting of all the players from those games.

This photo was from my 21st birthday in 2023, Josh and some hometown friends were in town for a bachelor party in San Luis Obispo California drinking in a makeshift VIP section at my friend groups’ local bar. I called my buddy, and begged him to grab the jersey from my closet and bring it downtown. By fate, or by luck, the bouncer was a friend of a friend and let me go upstairs the back door for $20. I asked the bartender for a sharpie, and bought josh and his friends a round of vodka redbulls. 
The security let me deliver the drinks, I used that as an opportunity to shake his hand tell him how much of a fan I am. He signed my jersey and thanked me for the drinks. Really great dude!",7263.0,neutral

Kincaid missed ATL and  HOU, the two games where the offense has looked absolutely constipated.  He missed almost the entire 2nd half against MIA and that's when things fell apart.

As younger generations, it's tempting to think that we invented the stupid shit and rituals, but every once and a while my dad would drop some story about tailgating in backyards on Best St. or other shenanigans they did at the rockpile - importing contraband, broadcasting play by play on a megaphone, or charging the field for the goal posts.

Miss ya, Pops!  I’m sorry for your loss; what a great memory you have of him and this team! 

My dad made me a Bills fan as well, and when we lost last year, I finally let the tears fall lol, and my dad told me this is what he’s been doing all his life lol, I really hope we can just win one while he’s still here with me.

Players get old and banged up and lose a step or three. They’re also mostly multi-millionaires who chose to pursue a career in a pretty brutal sport because of that upside, and that goes both ways. The money that comes in powers the money that goes out to them. It’s a team and a culture, sure, but it’s also a competition and a business. Resources need to go to who will get the best results, not whose vibe we appreciate.

Is it me, or does anyone else feel like this org has hamstrung itself over the last 5 years prioritizing overpaying or sticking with the right vibes or fan favorites instead of treating the roster like franchises that win big? I.e. hunt dudes that help you win, get rid of or get resources for dudes that don’t.

The parasocial shit with dudes on this team (it exists for other teams too I bet, but I’m not fans of other teams so I’m not paying attention) is getting to be too much. These guys aren’t our friends, they’re millionaire performers. Sure, they can do great things for the community, but the dudes who do that on this team would do it anywhere. We’re not special. Do you want your team to be feel good dudes you like but can never quite get it done, or dudes competing for a spot on a team that wins big?

Pegula would rather tune out and rake in the money from having 10ish wins and maybe a home playoff game every year, especially with the new stadium on the way.

Also, there is no point debating whether McDermott *or* Beane have to go. They are a package deal. McDermott hired Beane, reports directly to Pegula, and has a huge sway in roster decisions; he's effectively the team CEO.

 IMO this year has been a disaster.

Josh Allen is a very good quarterback, nevertheless sitting in the pocket has never been when he is at his best! Why are they trying to make him sit in the pocket taking away from our best players strengths makes absolutely no sense. Then again neither does recycling players. We’ve already gotten rid of.

1p3z1r2,1763832925.0,154118,0.76,214,Discuss,"Rumors of the demise of the Bills OL are greatly exaggerated 
I’ve read a number of posts about how bad the Bills OL was on Thursday and that they gave Josh no time to throw.   And how the Bills OL now “sucks,” when in the past it was one of the best in the NFL.  The actual film shows something different.

The average time to throw is 3.2 seconds.  Josh had more than that on every one of the sacks he took.   Also Houston has the number one defense and probably the best overall pass rush from the DL.   Everyone knows your QB needs to get rid of the ball quickly versus a front that can rush like Houston.  

Don’t get me wrong, the OL had a bad night.  Some of these sacks were their fault.  Spencerport Brown should not have been in the game after his injury and was responsible for 2 alone. And Dion Dawkins false start on 3rd and 1 was an absolute killer.  

But to pretend that the 8 sacks were all on the OL just isn’t the case and that they are a crappy unit is just not accurate.  They had one of their worst games of the season, but coming into this game they were one of the best pass blocking units. 

So what’s the problem?

- WR not getting open and winning matchups 
- Brady not giving Josh answers
- OL losing 
- Josh just not seeing the field

Obviously it a mix of everything.  But I think there’s a huge gap between first two bullets and the last two bullets.  

What do you think?

I’ve read a number of posts about how bad the Bills OL was on Thursday and that they gave Josh no time to throw.   And how the Bills OL now “sucks,” when in the past it was one of the best in the NFL.  The actual film shows something different.

The average time to throw is 3.2 seconds.  Josh had more than that on every one of the sacks he took.   Also Houston has the number one defense and probably the best overall pass rush from the DL.   Everyone knows your QB needs to get rid of the ball quickly versus a front that can rush like Houston.  

Don’t get me wrong, the OL had a bad night.  Some of these sacks were their fault.  Spencerport Brown should not have been in the game after his injury and was responsible for 2 alone. And Dion Dawkins false start on 3rd and 1 was an absolute killer.  

But to pretend that the 8 sacks were all on the OL just isn’t the case and that they are a crappy unit is just not accurate.  They had one of their worst games of the season, but coming into this game they were one of the best pass blocking units.

 Seems like one thing James Cook could do better is his scramble drill. Pass pro aside one thing Ty Johnson seems better at is finding open grass. 

Almost think it would be interesting to see if Buffalo can kinda take from Miami and when they have those intermediate distances they use the ""cheat"" motions with Cook and Ty with Cook being the receiver your hoping to get in space with an option to hand off to Ty.

Heck you try some creative stuff with Ty and Cook in the backfield while having the receivers go back to the ol' deep cross go brr. However it's scheme up seems like you should do it so that Cook or Shakir is streaking across Allen's face with a head of steam behind them.",85948.0,negative
1p3z1r2,1763841270.0,526,0.76,214,Discuss,"Rumors of the demise of the Bills OL are greatly exaggerated 
I’ve read a number of posts about how bad the Bills OL was on Thursday and that they gave Josh no time to throw.   And how the Bills OL now “sucks,” when in the past it was one of the best in the NFL.  The actual film shows something different.

The average time to throw is 3.2 seconds.  Josh had more than that on every one of the sacks he took.   Also Houston has the number one defense and probably the best overall pass rush from the DL.   Everyone knows your QB needs to get rid of the ball quickly versus a front that can rush like Houston.  

Don’t get me wrong, the OL had a bad night.  Some of these sacks were their fault.  Spencerport Brown should not have been in the game after his injury and was responsible for 2 alone. And Dion Dawkins false start on 3rd and 1 was an absolute killer.  

But to pretend that the 8 sacks were all on the OL just isn’t the case and that they are a crappy unit is just not accurate.  They had one of their worst games of the season, but coming into this game they were one of the best pass blocking units. 

So what’s the problem?

- WR not getting open and winning matchups 
- Brady not giving Josh answers
- OL losing 
- Josh just not seeing the field

Obviously it a mix of everything.  But I think there’s a huge gap between first two bullets and the last two bullets.  

What do you think? 

 I like your gap observation at the end.",85948.0,neutral

First off...Tre, Milano and Daquan are scheduled to be UFAs in 2026 so ""saying goodbye"" is already happening and doesn't save any money whatsoever. In fact, Milano and Daquan are both carrying dead cap hits into 2026 totaling $14.7M(Milano 11 & Jones 3.7) and that's regardless of if they re-sign, retire, or sign elsewhere.

The other 4 will save some money if released BUT not $45.5M. Per spotrac, releasing the other 4 (Knox, Samuel, Bass, & Rapp) with pre 6/1 releases would save Bills about $22.2M and carrry $13.57 in dead cap hits. 

Add that to Milano/Jones and the other scheduled FAs that have void years (Bosa, McGovern, Epenesa & Ogunjobi) and that brings Buffalo's initial dead cap from void years to $32.1M before they even get started. 

So saying goodbye to those guys saves about $22.2M and will cost roughly $13.6M in dead hits.",836916.0,negative

Go Bills. Yea but why? Just cause you feel it?

I’m not being a jerk. I’m just looking at the team and seeing not a slump, or sloppiness. I’m seeing some fundamental weak links (like 7 separate things!)), and I think there’s enough film out there on us for basically every team to have a shot at beating us. 


If Josh goes into god mode, meaning zero mistakes, pure confidence, comfortable in pocket, making crazy plays, for literally 40 straight quarters, then maybe. 

But he’d had to do that with a plethora of defensive injuries, a line that is now compromised, and no receivers that put other teams into tricky positions. Something’s up with Dion Dawkins too. soooooo many false starts, and his feet’s are looking slow. He looks heavier too. 

To me it seems like a near impossible task. 

Next year looks bleak too. Knox and Bernard contracts were bad choices. And now we have too many gaps to fill in one offseason.

We are 2-4 in our last six games.  Every win was against a team .500 or less as their record.

Booooo) but please don't take this the wrong way people. 

I feel like this team is SO BAD that I think it needs to be rebuilt. I think it may take a couple to a few years for it to be good again. Josh is officially wasted here. I feel his only shot at a SB would be on another team, another team that isn't as dysfunctional, and loaded with talent. He is about to turn 30, has taken some massive hits over the years. It feels unfair to make him have to play through some rebuilds at this point. I don't ""want"" him gone, I am just saying that his chance for a ring has been diminished here. Because we have so many old/older players on the team, I feel like if we clean house the team is starting over. On top of that, if we let go of a lot of our old defensive players, Beane is going to have to spend another off season or two building the defense back up. That means more time and resources spent on defense and not offense.

It just feels like an absolute mess here. I feel bad for him. I realize he could go to another team and still not get a ring, but the way this organization and team is looking these days, I don't think it is happening here. 

It is honestly sad to watch. My only other hail mary thought would be for Beane to just say ""fuck it"" and go all in like the Rams and Eagles have done, and try and get as many star players as you can and see if you can make some magic happen. I don't know of any other quick fixes. Josh may play till 35-40 or the hits piling up may make him want to retire sooner. I just hate to see his career wasted.",9124278.0,negative

They've lost 1 home game in 2 years.

Knox, Samuel, and Rapp are all easy outs with not too bad dead cap hits. The 2022 draft signings are all on modest deals that don’t really kick in until 2027. Ed Oliver is the only really heavy contract who’s massively overpaid and he’s still a productive player just not worth his cap charge and the Bills can get out of it after next season.

The Bills dead cap/void years number is likely to be around 40 million which is slightly above average but not tragic. The Bills also don’t have too much void years in the future like the Eagles do so if they want to spam out void years they can as they have almost 0 void dollars in 2027 and beyond. Palmers also another bad one but he’s an out after next season and I think they can still get production out of him and he’s not tragically overpaid.

The issue isn’t the cap as much as it is the fact that the types of players they need are super hard to get on the cheap and the bills won’t be drafting high enough to get them either.

The bills will need to find an impact pass rusher and number one WR while maintaining what they have at other positions such as keeping most of the oline together. Resigning Edwards or McGovern and finding some help at LB will be needs but needs they can probably figure out rather easily. 

In order to get that done the Bills will need to take risks on guys with character flaws or injuries and hope to get a hit on a WR and a pass rusher because with a heavy QB contract and other pieces in place like a well paid pair of OT’s the Bills will need to get creative and aggressive",2112449.0,negative

1. I've been a Beane and McDermott defender for many years, but I'm ready to move on. The message in the locker room has clearly gone stale and now we're losing games we are favored in. We've given out contracts to B level players that have hampered our abilities to get a true game changer via FA. The roster itself is just not talented outside of Allen and Cook. Lots of mediocrity around them and when those two are unable to get going, we get exposed.

2. The injuries on this team are out of control. Some of it is bad luck, sure, but at some point you have to point to the roster construction. Beane and McDermott favor smaller, speedy guys for their scheme. The problem is smaller usually equals more injury prone. Just think about it- Oliver, Milano, Bernard are all small for their position groups and it's no coincidence each of them has missed a ton of time in the last few seasons. Then we hold onto aging dudes past their prime like White, Taron, and Poyer. It's only a matter of time before it compounds.

3. I want to believe we always have a chance with Josh Allen b/c he is very talented, but even someone like him has limitations if the coaching and play calling doesn't help him out. This team is vastly superior at home than the road, and right now we're slated to have to go on the road 3 times to get to a SB.

He was throwing it late and over the middle for Ints against the Cheats.

This season he is not seeing the field well and isn’t taking what the defense is giving us. He is forcing a lot of bad throws and that is on him. 

Hopefully this mini-bye gives him some time to regain his form and make better decisions.  Yeah but the question is why. If you think he just reverted to forcing plays and missing targets then you're free to do that, but imo he doesn't mesh with this scheme and doesn't trust the receivers or the line. ",74272.0,negative

The scheme relies on rushing 4 and dropping everyone else back in coverage. If you don't have a world beater DE/DT it just doesn't work. The best we've had was an old Von Miller that was productive until he got hurt after like 10 weeks.

Currently we have an injured Ed and he's about as hot and cold as it gets. He also seems to get injured right when it finally clicks. Rinse and repeat.

Groot, think he's great as a run stopper, has an insane wingspan, but he's not very fluid and lacks the quick twitch that you really want on the edge.

Epenesa is.. alright? He's there, puts in effort, but basically a lesser groot.

Then we have the revolving door of Jones, Phillips, and whatever 1 year signing we have on the interior mixed in with young guys that never seem to stay healthy or haven't fully developed.

The second level isn't much better.

Milano is getting old, injured often.

Taron looks straight up washed.

Poyer's at the end of his career and a shell of himself.

Tre White had two major lower half non contact injuries that robbed him of all his athleticism

Bernard, a guy the relies on his mental ability to make up for his physical shortcomings but now he's even slower and less athletic this year due to injury (crazy how much better we looked with Thompson in tonight) 

Benford who is having a down year, and i never really believed he'd sustain the level of play he had last year.

Max that's just finally getting on the field

Cole that is just now finally getting the hang of it.

We've always been really thin outside of the D Line on defense because McDermott loves his rotation, so we end up thin at LB, DB and safety, which always seems to bite us at some point (AJ Klein playing in the playoffs coming out of retirement from off his couch because we literally had no other option)

It's a combination of the schemes shortcomings (lack of depth, reliance on great d-line play that we've never really had) hit and miss drafting/development, and most of our key difference makers getting old/injured (poyer, milano, tre, taron, hyde.) 

The lack of turnovers generated has really killed us too. We used to be one of the best teams at taking the ball away, and now I feel like we're one of the worst.",481724.0,negative

In the 2nd half the D held Houston to three 3 and outs and 1 FG on 4 possessions which is pretty damn impressive given the short fields the offense kept leaving them. The D kept them in the game then gave the offense multiple chances to win it down the stretch.

They held Houston to 108 yards rushing and 153 yards passing. Any time your D holds an opponent to 261 yards, you should win easily.

Yet the offense only managed to get 3 points in the 2nd half. And if we want to really count offensive points, they only scored 12 points all game! 12!

The cap numbers also open up considerably in 2027 and a *lot* in 2028. There aren't many guys signed through 2028 but the ones who are are definitely core contributors.

This is what happens when you have a bunch of guys on longer term deals in the NFL. Sometimes they look like good deals (Allen being a prime example) and sometimes they look terrible as guys age out or underperform.

Our GM and Head coach pushed the chips in to go for it for a few more years with the old roster (poyer, Hyde, daquan Jones, Jordan Phillips etc).

We were crazy injured and our players were really old (these things weren't 100% unrelated), so that went poorly.

To do this though, we extended a bunch of guys like Diggs and now have dead cap hits. That means our salary cap isnt in great shape because we're still paying off guys that used to play for us.

Our defence has been bad for a few years as we play practice squad guys, because our best players were all injured or 34 years old or both.

Now we're putting 3 or 4 rookies on the field every snap. Our defence is going to be both cheap and unimpressive for a while.

We have *all* of our building blocks under contract. If we extend them for another year or cut them a bonus, we can wipe out their cap hit and make a bunch of space.",44469.0,negative

I'm more worried about that than 1 to 2 spots in the standings (provided that it is not putting us in serious danger of missing the playoffs, but we clearly control our own destiny in that regard.

The Steelers winning hurts both the Ravens (divisional) and the Chiefs (were they to fight for a Wild Card spot), and the Colts and Jaguars winning also make it more difficult for the Chiefs to make the playoffs. I will be rooting for all three of these teams in Week 12.",14113.0,positive

I have been a bills fan all my life -- I had a lifesized Bruce Smith fathead in my childhood bedroom and  Lee Evans painted on my wall. Like many, I was a fan during the eras of JP Losman, Trent Edwards, Ej Manuel, etc. Growing up in Arizona, it felt like I was the sole bills fan in a 100 mile radius, having to defend my team vs the hordes of Chargers, Cowboys, and bandwagon Patriots fans that infected my hometown.

Now, we're 7-3 with an elite team that is about to make the playoffs again (knock on wood..) and yet, every fan I talk to is miserable. It has gotten to the point where my interactions with fans (online and in real life) are ruining the experience and joy of watching the team. People are always finding new complaints about players and coaches. Calling for firings, benchings, and just shitting on me if I try to point out any positive in our performance. 

I get that we've had some tough losses. I get we've come up short in the playoffs. But the world is not ending. Our championship window is still wide open, including this year. The goal is to win a superbowl and I have 100% faith the coaches and players are doing all they can to try to make that a reality. A single loss in any season, or three, or even five does not mean we are the worst team in the world. 

Sorry for the rant, but I just wish we could be a little happier about our team and celebrate our wins a little more. We're in the good ole days now, and I'd like to enjoy it. A decade or two from now, we'll be looking back and wishing that we had this team again.  It’s because our existence is based on our algorithm. 27 years ago you could simply not watch ESPN or listen to talk radio. You could just skip the sports section of Buffalo News all together. Now you can’t escape it because of your phone. Plus everything online has to be a 10 alarm fire 24/7. Everyone  online appears angrier than they actually are.",30226052.0,neutral

But Josh is 29 and is a first ballot HOF lock and will likely be the best Bill of our lifetime along with Bruce Smith. It will be a huge bummer if we don’t at least get to a Super Bowl with him. But we have had a ton of amazing Sundays thanks to him and the other legends on this team the last 5+ years.

Yep, the Pats were not \*EXPECTED\* to be so good and that puts a thorn in our side. (\*Wahhh they were so good for so long, it's OUR turn, go 'way stupid Pats!\*) But that's not how life is. 

We get to ride with the Bills on the ups and downs. Do we love them, like for real? And if we love Joshie boy so much, then we get to ride or die with him. 

Our team ain't perfect, obvy no team is, but they're hella good even despite all the injuries on D. 

When you change your attitude to gratitude, man, everything changes. Instead of EXPECTATIONS, be thankful we have a fun, record-setting, ONLY QB in NFL HISTORY and enjoy the ride!

I certainly had more fun last year, and so I am letting go of all expectations and just going to enjoy from here out, no matter what happens. And, in the back of my mind, I'll be hoping/wishing/praying for a BIG Bills offseason........ 

FWIW, my 2 cents, rock on fam.... & go Bills.",424523.0,neutral

I have been a bills fan all my life -- I had a lifesized Bruce Smith fathead in my childhood bedroom and  Lee Evans painted on my wall. Like many, I was a fan during the eras of JP Losman, Trent Edwards, Ej Manuel, etc. Growing up in Arizona, it felt like I was the sole bills fan in a 100 mile radius, having to defend my team vs the hordes of Chargers, Cowboys, and bandwagon Patriots fans that infected my hometown.

A decade or two from now, we'll be looking back and wishing that we had this team again.  context on the whole league should be taken into consideration when discussing the bills tbh. chiefs struggling. ravens struggling but battling. houston is hot garbage half the time. all the division leaders from last year (besides the bills) are trying to find a way to get a wildcard. this is a weird year and we’re the only team still in prime position from last year. 

we’ve seen this from the bills before. start hot, falter for a couple weeks, get hot again. we definitely have flaws ala the run defense but if we catch fire late in the year, the superbowl is definitely doable. i don’t have faith in fixing the run D based on the defense we play. running two linebackers, one undersized leads to those big runs if our d line can’t stuff it. tampa getting linemen to the second level picking off 185lbers definitely shows that.  our secondary is playing much better with bishop and hairston emerging. hell even poyer is putting in solid work. still with those flaws, the d stepped up in key situations to limit the damage. 

if brady can keep up with the aggressive playcalling and allen balling out, we always have a chance. doomers will doom. it is what it is but the nfl is funky and all about timing/match ups. i think the rumors of our demise are very much exaggerated.",254714.0,neutral

But with the reports of the missed meetings and lack of professionalism he’s rightfully (imo) getting called out. 

If he was putting up #1 WR numbers, no one would give a shit. But if you’re gonna stink on the field, and then give people the impression (rightly or wrongly) that you aren’t taking it serious or putting in the work to become better you’ll quickly become public enemy #1.",19596592.0,positive

I'm a bit surprised by Walker, as it didn't feel like the interior defensive line played well against the run on Sunday, though it's always hard to really gauge IDL play on the live broadcast.

  
Other interesting/notable grades:

Offense:

* Tyrell Shavers: 79.5 grade. Amazing game from him. I genuinely think he might be an answer going forward for this team. He can actually create vertical separation to go along with his blocking. Excited to see him get these kinds of snaps next week too hopefully.
* Josh Allen 72.4 grade. Probably the most fun I've had watching Josh this season. Couple of mistakes that lower the grade but an amazing performance nonetheless.
* Gabe Davis: 70.4 grade. Happy for Gabe. This 4th WR role is where he can provide a ton of value for us. The Mack Hollins role.
* Curtis Samuel: 64.9 grade. Great blocking from him. Hopefully we can keep sprinkling him in going forward.

  
Defense:

* Dorian Williams: 82.5 grade. I LOVE the role McDermott and company have devised for Dorian this year. 3rd LB on run plays that allows him to play downhill, and spy on passing downs that once again allows him to make the most out of his athleticism. It's been a brillian wrinkle on defense this year to be honest and has made a big difference both against Tampa and KC.
* DaQuan Jones: 76.9 grade. Glad he's back healthy. 
* Cole Bishop: 73.2 grade. He's quietly now a top 15 safety in the league through 11 games for PFF. He has absolutely reached a completely new level in the last month. So excited for him moving forward.
* Christian Benford: 71.1 grade. His best grade of the season, hopefully a sign of things to come in what's been a disappointing season for Benford so far.
* Jordan Poyer: 69.5 grade. I just love Poyer. Bills legend.
* Terrel Bernard: 67.2 grade. I thought this was probably his best game of the season watching it live. He's been really bad most of the year and he's probably injured but good to see him making plays.
* Maxwell Hairston: 55.8 grade. Honestly didn't notice him much this game. He had a 28.7 run defense grade and 69.1 coverage grade. 
* Joey Bosa: 49.5 grade. I think this was probably his worst game of the season. I think the wrist is bothering him and I'd honestly sit him for a couple of games at some point. We need him to be as close to 100% as possible come Playoff time.
* Javon Solomon: 43.8 grade. Almost always part of the bottom 3 grades every week. Poor all-around, and now two weeks in a row with stupid penalties. I can't believe he has this kind of leash. Morgan Fox needs to take that role soon. If Deon Walker hits his potential it really would change how I think about this defense going forward",274831.0,positive

* Josh Allen 72.4 grade. Probably the most fun I've had watching Josh this season. Couple of mistakes that lower the grade but an amazing performance nonetheless.
* Gabe Davis: 70.4 grade. Happy for Gabe. This 4th WR role is where he can provide a ton of value for us. The Mack Hollins role.
* Curtis Samuel: 64.9 grade. Great blocking from him. Hopefully we can keep sprinkling him in going forward.

  
Defense:

* Dorian Williams: 82.5 grade. I LOVE the role McDermott and company have devised for Dorian this year. 3rd LB on run plays that allows him to play downhill, and spy on passing downs that once again allows him to make the most out of his athleticism. It's been a brillian wrinkle on defense this year to be honest and has made a big difference both against Tampa and KC.
* DaQuan Jones: 76.9 grade. Glad he's back healthy. 
* Cole Bishop: 73.2 grade. He's quietly now a top 15 safety in the league through 11 games for PFF. He has absolutely reached a completely new level in the last month. So excited for him moving forward.
* Christian Benford: 71.1 grade. His best grade of the season, hopefully a sign of things to come in what's been a disappointing season for Benford so far.
* Jordan Poyer: 69.5 grade. I just love Poyer. Bills legend.
* Terrel Bernard: 67.2 grade. I thought this was probably his best game of the season watching it live. He's been really bad most of the year and he's probably injured but good to see him making plays.
* Maxwell Hairston: 55.8 grade. Honestly didn't notice him much this game. He had a 28.7 run defense grade and 69.1 coverage grade. 
* Joey Bosa: 49.5 grade. I think this was probably his worst game of the season. I think the wrist is bothering him and I'd honestly sit him for a couple of games at some point. We need him to be as close to 100% as possible come Playoff time.
* Javon Solomon: 43.8 grade. Almost always part of the bottom 3 grades every week. Poor all-around, and now two weeks in a row with stupid penalties. I can't believe he has this kind of leash. Morgan Fox needs to take that role soon. Bernard must be hurt, he looked better yesterday but still not great. Watching him chasing Mayfield over to the sideline, he looked s l o w. I also don’t understand why Solomon gets so much playing time. Yes we have injuries but he needs to be the absolute last option off the bench.

Then it's basically the RB 1 on 1 vs a safety in the open field, which if your RB can't beat a safety 1 on 1 in the open field, why is he even on the team?

I was never the biggest fan of him, but I think Gabe Davis coming back is very good for Allen. You could tell throughout multiple games that he just didn’t trust these receivers outside of Shakir and Kincaid. Having a guy like Gabe who might not be a world beater but has that time on task with Allen definitely gave him more confidence. There was one third down where he rifled it in there in tight coverage, and I’m not sure he throws that ball to anyone else on the team.

My takeaway from this game is clearly Brady is allowing Allen to play more like himself. Whether that was something Mcdermott egged him to do, i don't know.

Not to excuse Allen because i know he did have mistakes, but i think it's going to take him a few games to get back to playing like himself and not being just handoffs and short throws like what he's been being forced to do through Brady. I hope they continue to let Allen play. Sure, he had those 2 turnovers and so did Baker. Allen still put up insane numbers and that is the Allen that runs this team and who the offense should flow through.

One of the biggest changes in the offence yesterday was getting Johnson and Cook both involved in the passing game when the run game wasn’t working. 8 out of 10 games this year Cook has had less than 25yrds receiving. 7 of 10 less than 10yrds. 5/10 he’s had 1 or 0 targets.

Cook needs to continue to be a threat to come out of the back field as a receiver to keep defences honest. It’s a problem with Brady’s player usage. Same issue he has with using Kincaid and tipping pass or run based on who is on the field.  

Run defence, what more can be said at this point. They suck and there is probably no changing that. It’s been this way for years and will probably continue this way while McD is coach.",991603.0,positive

On one hand, it was genuinely awesome to see how Allen is still an absolute dog who can lock in and just carry an offense by playing hero ball, even with the bad turnovers he still did a lot more good stuff than bad stuff in that game. The weird feeling comes from how as fun hero ball is to watch, it’s really not realistically sustainable week to week, and we still come out of the game with questions in the receiver corps and about the defense.

One of my absolute favorites from this era of Bills football.  I was one of Bishops biggest detractors, but the difference in play since being paired with Poyer has been night and day.

Poyer isn’t a world beater but he’s played solid , he’s positionally sound, and he doesn’t miss many tackles.

Maybe it’s mentorship or maybe it’s just that Bishop isn’t having to deal with busted coverage as much. Either way, Poyer has been a net improvement.",1659569.0,neutral

I kept my original message short because I was freezing. Every person we met here was awesome. We tailgated with someone we met at the hotel. They fed us and kept us warm. I had no idea these hand warmer packets existed until today but thanks to our new friends they came in so clutch. 

The experience just seeing the field for the first time left me speechless for a few minutes. This is the field I grew up watching on tv to be here was just something else.

Once we were in the stadium (Section 308) the people around us made the experience so much better. Everyone was really nice and just as crazy about the Bills.

The cherry on top of course was the game itself. Started out a bit tough and it wouldn’t be a Bills game without it raising my blood pressure a bit. Glad we got the W and I was able to experience it with the greatest fans in sports!",89813.0,negative

1oyl9he,1763298726.0,22627,0.9,74,Discuss,"On the talking point that Josh “picked” Keon With the rumors of Keon being a healthy scratch today, there’s of course been a lot of discussion about Keon’s role and his draft pick. One talking point that’s frequently brought up is that “well, Josh wanted / picked him”.

I’m not sure how exactly that idea started and circulated, but it’s a bit of a misrepresentation of the draft process from what we on the outside know, based on comments by Josh and Beane both. There’s more nuance to the situation, as evidenced by the quotes organized chronologically below.

Allen on the QB Room podcast, **pre-draft**:

> “Can I not like the guys that probably won’t be there? I think the top three guys, Malik Nabers, Rome Odunze and Marvin Harrison Jr., are three pretty great prospects. Then you get to that kind of secondish tier--if you will--of Bryan Thomas, Adonai Mitchell. I think Keon Coleman, Troy Franklin, Xavier Worthy are all there (and) Xavier Legette. To watch these guys at the combine, some fast, big, tall, heavy dudes. It was pretty impressive to watch.”

Beane on Sirius XM NFL Radio **after the draft**:

> “[Josh’s] been in the building the last couple of weeks now that the offseason program's started. So we did give him some guys, we said, 'Hey, sit back with the coaches, y'all watch them together and talk about how you'd use them. I'd like to hear what you see.' **And he liked a lot of the guys, he really did. But Keon was one -- I know he liked him a lot, too. And Josh and I didn't speak on Thursday, really. Maybe he stopped by that morning. But that next day, Friday morning, he FaceTimed me. Actually, I was still at home before I headed in here. And he was like, 'What are you thinking?' And I said, 'Well, barring somebody blowing me away, I'm going to take Keon.'** And he was pretty pumped."" (Emphasis mine)

It reads here pretty clearly that Josh wanted a receiver and watched a lot of them including but not limited to Keon; Beane and the rest of the front office presumably conferred and more or less settled on Keon, and *then informed* Josh of the pick.

Now, in defense of the idea that Josh picked him, Josh *did* go on to text Keon during the draft to say

>  “You're the guy I want. I watched a lot of receivers and I want to play with you""

To me, though, that reads as reaching out in encouragement as a teammate with the pick already being locked in.

**Some discussion points**
- How much input does or should a player have in the draft process?
- To what extent is it valuable or productive for offensive players to be close to or friends with the quarterback? Do we need more of an “adversary” / edge in the receiver room?
- **If** Keon is a healthy scratch today, what does that mean for him moving forward? I don’t really understand the point of people highlighting this. Josh is the QB, sure his input is useful but it’s the job of the GM to make the final judgement on the talent that can help the team. Let’s not deflect the blame from beane.",1527322.0,neutral

- **If** Keon is a healthy scratch today, what does that mean for him moving forward? Can't overlook the fact that most every college player needs to continue developing their skills and talents in the NFL to fully realize their potential. That is still a work in progress with Keon. There have been moments, but it's very inconsistent. It's way too early to call him a bust and I don't 'blame' Josh for the pick.

The text, sounds like the GM told him the pick and he sent the text to get some good will ahead of time. I bet it happens more than we know. 

All seems pretty normal to me. The kid can still be a bust, there doesn't need to be special circumstances explaining why Keon was picked. He was picked around where a typical GM would have picked him at the time, and the Bills needed an X badly.",65340.0,negative

Almost every single pass sent Keon's way last week was fired off target and most were directly sent at the cornerback. To the point that the best pass he dropped was a deflection that floated up into the air after hitting the corner in the facemask.

Keon has had more downs than ups, but last week definitely wasn't on him.

The fan base just isn't willing to admit that we still have sugar high Josh for a few games every year. It's fine. Lamar has odd games where someone sends cover zero at him forty times and he gets dumpstered. Mahomes has gone about 2 years now since he's been at the top of his game. Burrow is exceptional but just straight up blocks his staff from calling any motion or under centre plays, completely hamstringing his team.

No QB is perfect. Ours is close to it for 14 games a year, but he still has 3-4 sugar high games where he scrambles 6 times up the middle into two defensive tackles coming off their blocks and is dropped before getting back to the line of scrimmage. Or where he fires 4 or 5 balls several yards off target. Id still take him first overall, but people are being delusional saying that these struggles are on anyone else.",49005.0,negative

- **If** Keon is a healthy scratch today, what does that mean for him moving forward? Here's where Beane annoys me. Every year, the great gm's go into the draft with the mindset of picking the 'best player available'. Beane tries to echo that throughout the draft process, but he doesn't stick to it. In 2020, we needed a pass rusher but didn't have a 1st rd pick due to Diggs.. he grabs Epenesa in rd 2. 2021, pass rush still lacked, grabs Rousseau. 2022, we needed a corner. I'm damn near certain that McDuffie was our guy, but the Chiefs jumped us, and we reached for a man corner in Elam. In 2023, Kincaid is probably the only pick where Beane really stuck to the 'best player available' strategy, albeit in a position that usually doesn't deliver superstars in the first round. Then, just this year, we grab another corner because Elam was a bust. 

Look at the Eagles and how they draft. Lineman, lineman, lineman. We can use an upgrade at tight end? Nah, draft a monster DT that fell to us because he smoked a little weed in college. We need a corner? Screw that, how about another DT. We're weak at WR? Draft a DE instead and continue to dominate where the games are actually won and lost. Then, throughout the season, when you see talent lacking, grab an AJ Brown, or hell, just look at what they did last week. Traded for Jaire Alexander, Jalen Phillips,  and Michael Carter II. They are the defending champions, looking to win another chip. Beane wants to win by building it on his own. The only problem is that Beane whiffs on most of his top draft picks.

Josh Allen is obviously an outlier, but, in general, I would say players should not have a say in the draft.  GMs and Coaches gotta know more about the overall picture than the QB.  Now, again, do I think that Josh Allen might very well have good insight into what kind of receiver he would like?  Okay, yes, but I'm still hesitant.  Why?  For precisely this (partly perceived) situation.  If some WR thinks he's ""Josh's guy,"" well, he might, say, show up late to meetings or be off-task when he's supposed to be growing...

I think receivers NEED TO be on the same tactical page with the QB, especially one who goes ""off script"" the way JA17 does.  Gabe Davis was notoriously wrong in big situations that led to INTs.  (Yes he was also very, very right in some big situations, too.)  However, the Diggs situation did not work out.  Diggs, from my perspective, demanded too much attention from Josh on reads and this led to dead drives, especially in key situations.  He did not, ultimately, deliver in big games and instead sucked up plays that could have gone successfully elsewhere.  I do not think Allen needs someone to come in here and yap at him or to kick him in the pants.  He's Josh Allen.  (I do believe his play this year has been off.  The accuracy, the decision-making, the creation of offense; it's all down.)

Nobody knows what Keon will do next.  I'm not entirely convinced that his struggles are entirely his fault.  Even 51% his fault.  I don't think he's being used properly on every down and I think the inability to use Moore or Samuel correctly has put a LOT of pressure on the kid.  But, I'm assuming the hope is that this motivates him and gets his butt in gear.",16335.0,neutral

And ultimately it doesn't matter, it's on the GM for picking him knowing he was a bit of a projection, the staff for trying to fit him into a role he's not ready for (or maybe never will be) and Keon for not improving in the areas he needed to. 

Best case scenario is this is like when Josh had to sit out games as a rookie when he was injured. Keon is still really young and has physical tools he can build on.

I’m not sure how exactly that idea started and circulated, but it’s a bit of a misrepresentation of the draft process from what we on the outside know, based on comments by Josh and Beane both. There’s more nuance to the situation, as evidenced by the quotes organized chronologically below.

Allen on the QB Room podcast, **pre-draft**:

> “Can I not like the guys that probably won’t be there? I think the top three guys, Malik Nabers, Rome Odunze and Marvin Harrison Jr., are three pretty great prospects. Then you get to that kind of secondish tier--if you will--of Bryan Thomas, Adonai Mitchell. I think Keon Coleman, Troy Franklin, Xavier Worthy are all there (and) Xavier Legette. To watch these guys at the combine, some fast, big, tall, heavy dudes. It was pretty impressive to watch.”

Beane on Sirius XM NFL Radio **after the draft**:

> “[Josh’s] been in the building the last couple of weeks now that the offseason program's started. So we did give him some guys, we said, 'Hey, sit back with the coaches, y'all watch them together and talk about how you'd use them. I'd like to hear what you see.' **And he liked a lot of the guys, he really did. But Keon was one -- I know he liked him a lot, too. And Josh and I didn't speak on Thursday, really. Maybe he stopped by that morning. But that next day, Friday morning, he FaceTimed me. Actually, I was still at home before I headed in here. And he was like, 'What are you thinking?' And I said, 'Well, barring somebody blowing me away, I'm going to take Keon.'** And he was pretty pumped."" (Emphasis mine)

It reads here pretty clearly that Josh wanted a receiver and watched a lot of them including but not limited to Keon; Beane and the rest of the front office presumably conferred and more or less settled on Keon, and *then informed* Josh of the pick.

Now, in defense of the idea that Josh picked him, Josh *did* go on to text Keon during the draft to say

>  “You're the guy I want. I watched a lot of receivers and I want to play with you""

To me, though, that reads as reaching out in encouragement as a teammate with the pick already being locked in.

**Some discussion points**
- How much input does or should a player have in the draft process?
- To what extent is it valuable or productive for offensive players to be close to or friends with the quarterback? Do we need more of an “adversary” / edge in the receiver room?
- **If** Keon is a healthy scratch today, what does that mean for him moving forward? THANK YOU!!!! FINALLY lol I mustve had 5 people this week tell me Josh picked Keon & Kincaid and no matter how many times I used the term ""TOWING THE COMPANY LINE,"" so many Bills fans want to act like Josh makes Beane's moves, when in reality Beane is telling Josh what he's doing, and Josh supports his bosses decisions like a great employee should.",16335.0,negative

However, there are many examples of late blooming (3rd year) WR throughout NFL history. I think people writing Keon off completely are incorrect as well. I think it’s good if he gets benched today. Perhaps he will respond positively. Perhaps the coaches will reduce his role going forward which ironically (coupled with lower expectations) could increase his production.",8168.0,neutral

I feel like fans who were really too young for the SB Era Bills, romanticize the players and coaches from the Drought Era.  By that, I mean they overrate them and pretend that they were better than they actually were.   The Drought Era was the lowest time to be a Bills fan and these players and coaches, were incredibly frustrating to watch.  

Case in point, this tweet from super fan Brother Bill.  I’m thinking he’s in his 30’s or so.  Chan Gailey was a super likeable guy, pretty good offensive mind, he did a lot of offense with limited talent.  And yes, talking to the press moments after he got fired was incredibly admirable.  But as a head coach he was 16-32 with the Bills.  The most games he ever won was 6!  Let’s not pretend he was some kind of genius.   Much more maligned coaches like Dick Jauron and Doug Marrone - even Rex Ryan - won more games that Chan.  

Also I find the narrative that “he coached the Bills when no one else would” to be a little rich.  There were plenty of coaches that would have taken that job.  Of course, everyone knew that the Bills were an ownership was a dumpster fire and it limited candidates.  But at the end of the day, there are only 32 openings each year.  Plenty of assistants would have jumped. The only ones who declined were the big fish like Cowher and Shanahan.  Also Chan was on his couch when they made him HC after getting fired from Georgia Tech.  So it’s not like he was giving up much. 

To be fair, it’s not just Chan.  People look back on players Fitz, Stevie Johnson, Sammy Watkins, EJ Manuel…even Doug Whaley in glowing terms.  I get that these players were underdogs, but these teams were brutal to watch as a Bills fan.   Took one bad loss and suddenly the fanbase is yearning for Chan Gailey. Incredible",5881674.0,neutral

I'm not even sure if this is a recent tweet from brother Bill but he seems to be pretty reasonable with his takes. From a millenial bills perspective 


First things first. No one yearns for the drought era. What people remember fondly is  the fun moments in a shitty time. Fitz? Below average QB but fun as hell and relatable as a passed up everyman. Stevie. Unlutch af but effortlessly cool personality,. Marshawn? Garbage attitude but also cool as hell and a bowling ball runner. Chan? Sweet old grandpa, extremely likeable and could draw a hell of a screen (I'll always remember the inside screen on the goaline to Fred. The audacity). Actual head coach? Awful. Those defences were legitimately the worst thing I've ever witnessed. McDermott's D by contrast looks like the 85 Bears lol


Second, millenial Bills born in the 90s have only witnessed/remember losing. There was zero chance at ever challenging the Pats for the division. So we had to settle for in season moments. Why does this matter? Because it's only natural now to go from asking what if Brady wasn't in the division to what if Josh was around in those eras. When you witness a QB being able to drag teams to multiple division titles and playoff games you sort of empathize for past head coaches who had pedestrian QBs to work with. It's a natural fantasy to have particular as it becomes clearer and clearer that our Bills are stuck in the mud right now. Translation? Imagine Josh with the Schwartz D. Imagine Josh in Chans screen game. Imagine Josh going head to head with Brady. Or scramble throwing to Stevie. Or Lee Evans. Or in the red zone with Marshawn. It's harmless fun. ",72613.0,neutral

Diggs was also still a big contributor when Brady took over, defenses feared the Allen-Diggs passing threat and locked onto him, which opened up the running and short passing game. 

Cooper was also drawing coverage and helping open other guys up. Also made some tough catches in key moments that really helped us.

They find that meat still on the bone and work that into the offense, or they examine how teams might try to counter them and adjust accordingly.

Nothing about this offense looks like it's evolved since last season.

I mean you have Josh Allen.  The offense is going to be highly ranked regardless of who the offensive coordinator is.  The real question is can this team get over the same stumbling blocks we have every year.  Mainly losing games to inferior opponents that puts us on the road in the playoffs and then being out schemed by teams that are just as good as ours.",143472.0,neutral

He has an MVP QB, a good RB, and a good OL and the offense stalls constantly due to bad playcalling and scheme. 

There is an arrogance to his playcalling where he calls what he wants to call and doesn't change the gameplan to attack the weaknesses in the defense. There's also a lot of predictability in his playcalling. 

He doesn't deserve all of the blame as Josh's play this year and Beane's roster construction should get some blame as well. But the offense has looked terrible for >50% of games with plenty of talent.

I'm genuinely curious why everyone thinks his scheme sucks when Josh just came off an MVP season with the same guy? I'm not defending him I'm just wondering what changed from last season to now. The offense itself is way too predictable. The reason it was successful last year was it was the first full season under Brady and the first season of Allen w/o Diggs. Opposing teams did not know what to expect; they might have figured Allen would resort to his hero tendencies and try to do too much. Of course, to his credit Josh took what was given to him and ran it efficiently which culminated in winning MVP. I think that caught some D-coordinators off guard how he seemingly changed who he was and it led to tremendous success.

Now teams have wised up to the fact that they aren't going to be aggressive and try to take the top of the defense. Brady overcorrected to develop the run game (something I give him credit for) but it came at the expense of the pass game. Everyone knows if Cook is in the game we are running the ball, and if Kincaid is there we are passing. The personnel they trot out is a dead giveaway.

Brady needs to evolve and use variety with the talent we have. I agree the WR room isn't great, but it should definitely look better than this. His scheme is the majority of the issue b/c we've seen Josh still have the same magic from past years (look at that 3rd and 16 last week). We're just making it too hard for him.",47824.0,negative

At face value this seems like a strong declaration from Sean McDermott of support to Joe Brady this past Sunday.  But we’ve heard this before.  Go back to 2023 when Ken Dorsey’s offense started out hot but then struggled to put up 20 points a game.  

After a pretty lackluster loss to the Bengals, the very next day, McDermott was asked point blank if he was considering moving on from Dorsey and he said: 

“No... I remain confident in Ken and our offensive staff.""

Sound familiar?  

Buffalo did win the next week (against Tampa) 24-18, but there were still plenty of missed opportunities on offense.  

Less than two weeks later, following the awful loss to the Broncos, Ken Dorsey was fired, with McDermott citing the need for ""change"" and ""consistent production.""

So now back to 2025…after the embarrassing loss to Miami, McDermott gave Joe Brady his full support and commitment for the remainder of the season.  Jay Skurski (who asks tough questions) brought up Brian Daboll to which McDermott said he is “not under any type of consideration"" at this point.  The key words being “at this point.”  

That’s why I think this is a fluid situation that could change.  McDermott showed us in 2023 that a public vote of confidence doesn’t mean much if things don’t improve on offense and losses start piling up. 

He will make a move midseason  if the team is not performing to his standard, regardless of what he said last week.

If the offensive struggles agin with the lack of open receivers and the long time to throw over the next 2 games, I think there’s a chance he moves on from Brady.   I say this because the game versus Houston is on TNF.  It would give whoever the OC replacement is a few extra days to prepare.  

For this to happen, I think he has to consider Daboll.  Because there’s not really a great option on his staff unless he wants to turn Rob Boras or Aaron Kromer who last called plays over a decade ago.

At face value this seems like a strong declaration from Sean McDermott of support to Joe Brady this past Sunday.  But we’ve heard this before.  Go back to 2023 when Ken Dorsey’s offense started out hot but then struggled to put up 20 points a game.  

After a pretty lackluster loss to the Bengals, the very next day, McDermott was asked point blank if he was considering moving on from Dorsey and he said: 

“No... I remain confident in Ken and our offensive staff.""

Sound familiar?  

Buffalo did win the next week (against Tampa) 24-18, but there were still plenty of missed opportunities on offense.  

Less than two weeks later, following the awful loss to the Broncos, Ken Dorsey was fired, with McDermott citing the need for ""change"" and ""consistent production.""

So now back to 2025…after the embarrassing loss to Miami, McDermott gave Joe Brady his full support and commitment for the remainder of the season.  Jay Skurski (who asks tough questions) brought up Brian Daboll to which McDermott said he is “not under any type of consideration"" at this point.  The key words being “at this point.”  

That’s why I think this is a fluid situation that could change.  McDermott showed us in 2023 that a public vote of confidence doesn’t mean much if things don’t improve on offense and losses start piling up. 

He will make a move midseason  if the team is not performing to his standard, regardless of what he said last week.

If the offensive struggles agin with the lack of open receivers and the long time to throw over the next 2 games, I think there’s a chance he moves on from Brady.   I say this because the game versus Houston is on TNF.  It would give whoever the OC replacement is a few extra days to prepare.  

For this to happen, I think he has to consider Daboll.  Because there’s not really a great option on his staff unless he wants to turn Rob Boras or Aaron Kromer who last called plays over a decade ago.  IMO the stakes are too high to go with a first time play caller.  So perhaps that will buy Brady more time than Dorsey?

Of course, if the offense gets it shizznit together this week and next, then all of this moot.  What do you think? Is this different, or is it just history repeating itself? An offense that is “built around the QB playing at an extremely high level” is a dog shit offense. The elite offenses in the NFL aren’t offenses that are carried by QBs making great play after great play. 90% of the time it’s designed plays that make the QBs job easy, and then when you need your QB to be special for that last 10%, he comes through for you. The OC’s job is to make every thing easy and effective. Brady does that maybe twice a game. That’s awful. Josh has been down this year no doubt, but messing up a couple plays a game shouldn’t completely ruin an offense. It does with us because a well-schemed Brady play is so scarce for us, that you have to execute every single one that you get or else it completely stops the offense",39341.0,negative

If the offensive struggles agin with the lack of open receivers and the long time to throw over the next 2 games, I think there’s a chance he moves on from Brady.   I say this because the game versus Houston is on TNF.  It would give whoever the OC replacement is a few extra days to prepare.  

For this to happen, I think he has to consider Daboll.  Because there’s not really a great option on his staff unless he wants to turn Rob Boras or Aaron Kromer who last called plays over a decade ago.  IMO the stakes are too high to go with a first time play caller.  So perhaps that will buy Brady more time than Dorsey?

And to anyone wondering, The 10-6 Baltimore Ravens fired their OC Cam Cameron for Jim Caldwell and won the Super Bowl in 2012 in December at 9-4.  They got their offense together just at the right time.  

Of course, if the offense gets it shizznit together this week and next, then all of this moot.  What do you think? Is this different, or is it just history repeating itself? Josh needs an OC who will push/ challenge him, not a buddy and get complacent. Remember it’s not a hangout, it’s a business. Offense is too predictable. Blue print is out.",19671.0,negative

That's comparing the deal here got this year after we showcased him vs the deal we gave Samuel last year.

Better comparison would be Hollin's deal this year compared to Palmer's deal this year. From which, you could come to a very similar conclusion.

But when we signed Samuel and Hollins, at the time Hollins was a nobody and Samuel was established. When it came to re-sign Hollins we were already locked in with Samuel and couldn't get out, so there was never really a time we had to choose between the two.

My mother-in-law, Annie, has been the definition of a die-hard Bills fan for decades. She’s now in hospice with only a few weeks left after a long fight with pancreatic cancer.

The Bills have been one of the few things keeping her spirits up- she literally schedules her life around games, her closet is mostly Bills gear, and she still lights up every time she talks about the team.

I reached out to Kevin Kearns (Bills Director of Comms) earlier today, but I’m not sure if that’s the right channel or if there are others in the org who handle situations like this. We’re not looking for anything big.... even a short message, note, or quick video hello from a player would mean the absolute world to her.

If anyone here has experience with this, knows the best contact, or has advice on next steps, I’d be incredibly grateful.

Thank you so much for reading, and for being the kind of community where I feel comfortable asking!

Go Bills!!



\*\*UPDATE: I was able to get in touch with someone on the BB Community Impact team and they're sending Annie a Bills care package! It seems that's the team that definitely handles inquiries like this. We'll also likely do a Cameo for her- maybe Jim Kelly or Thurman Thomas. Cameo was a great idea! I seriously can't thank y'all enough for all the love, kind words, and suggestions and I'll make sure all your great messages are passed along to Annie :) I can’t offer any advice either but I hope this can happen for you.

 ah, the amateur film expert.  you cannot show stills of plays and claim guys are open or not open.  it's far more nuanced then that.  josh isn't a drone.  he can't hover over the field watching all wrs and wait for one to get open.  he needs to read the defense, figure out who SHOULD be open against that defense, and what your progression should be against it and then follow the progression.  if your guys aren't open in your progression, yet someone else is on the other side the field, it usually is the play design... or it could be the QB not getting through the progression fast enough.  either way its a lot more complicated then your painting it.

the first one for example, I remember this play.  both of those WRs stopped their routes.  completely stopped them, they didn't run the routes at all, and josh was looking to the opposite side of the field.  this tells me according to the defense, and the playcall, neither of those guys was a no.1 option against that defense, or maybe even in the progression tree at all.  now, you're right about palmer over the middle, when josh later rolls out on that play, he never looks at palmer though he's basically uncovered.  he was locked onto the TE.  i viewed this play as josh having zero faith in palmer.",215400.0,negative

 Stills aren't a very good way to assess a football game. 

A lot of these have defenders leveraging towards where the throw would go and they would probably break the pass up.

\#6 is crazy. Watch a live speed replay of that and tell me Keon was open. It's a terrible throw by Allen, but let's not pretend Keon was a viable option. 

\#7 is also crazy. The O-Line got caved in so Josh scrambles and throws for a TD. Keon wasn't even open - the safety would've closed on him.",83767.0,neutral

 1. He has 1 option, if he throws the deep ball…that’s an interception. The safety is playing so Josh reads it how you did. If he throws to Shakir, we are attending Shakirs funeral.

2. That’s not a slant and once again, Shakir dies if Josh puts it across the middle. If that outside guy runs a hitch, he may be open.

3. The still doesn’t tell enough and I don’t remember the play. If Josh is scrambling he throws off his back foot or the defender on the outside is watching Josh not the receiver, he collapses on that and breaks it up. Overall, just not a good play result for them.

4. I think this highlights a poor play. Seems all guys are converging on the same spot other than Kincaid who is cover on the corner route or over the top by the safety UNLESS Josh throws a perfect pass. And it’s 3 yards from where this still is or 13 yards towards the sideline….possible but cmon.

5. Still says nothing and no clue what down or yardage. But I’d agree that Samuel seems open and should’ve been thrown to without considering context of the game state.

6. Again, not a quick slant….thats a 7 yard drag, there’s also a lot of traffic where he would need to see that route.

I do think Josh misses some pretty open routes or places the ball poorly (there was a big Palmer catch in the game he got hurt in, I believe if Josh led him down field that’s a touchdown rather than a big play) but these examples don’t seem to support that narrative all too well.",35900.0,positive

 I've been a Beane supporter and I've been up and down on McD, but having Josh give a home team discount but still not have the FO able to channel that gift into major talent, and having the D continue to stink it up, and seeing the team CONSISTENTLY play down to their opponents has me about fed up. I wasn't able to watch the game last week, but I caught the score at halftime was 0-16. I thought ""oh, no, did Josh get hurt?!"" because that seemed like the only reasonable explanation to get shut out by the Fish. For whatever reason, this team does better when it has no expectations placed on them (see: last year, see: the crazy run (2022?) to overcome the collapsing Fish to win the division, etc.) and that speaks to coaching.

I've said it before and I'll say it again: I love having great people on this team to root for, but they seem to lack a killer instinct, and it really feels like that comes from the coaches being soft and timid. I mean that performance felt like it should have had a Jim Mora ""Playoffs?!"" rant after it. We've got Yacht Rock McD when we really need some punk or heavy metal attitude.",119640.0,neutral

 This team, at any given moment, is able to take down the best teams in the NFL, bar none. Theyre also able to inexplicably tear away your understanding of the world with bizarre losses to weak ass teams any given Sunday. A bad loss to a bad team will do serious damage. Consider the following:

Are the Bills actually good this year? Is Cole Bishop the best safety in the league? Do Bass fish swim away bc pin legged couch kickers are free on Thursdays? Is McDermott wearing women’s glasses? Is this all an illusion? If nothings real and wave collapse only renders what’s near me, where are the servers? Why aren’t there horses everywhere, all the time? BAM, Horses EVERYWHERE. 

Why does loving this team mean knowing the secrets of the universe and knowing nothing at all? How can McDaniels stick legs not be laughed out the locker room? How is any of this possible if the Bills are both SuperBowl contenders alive in the box, and a dead cat that losses to a team coached by a miniature caricature of every geeked out South FL douchebag compressed into a 5’9 frame?

How can you have the best weapon God ever created for football and waste it running the same 5 plays with no receivers?

Same with drafting outside of the top 20ish picking WR can be a pretty big dice roll. Not even sure if someone like McConkey would be a standout if he wasn’t in a WR room that was already pretty stacked.

If you want someone like JSN or BTJ you need to be bad enough to draft top 20, don’t think trading up makes sense when you need the picks because 13%-20% of the cap goes to Allen.

 I have repeatedly said I know nothing about football and purely speak on vibes. 

For McDermott and Beane the vibes are off. Look I think both of them could change that, I think everyone involved in this team is capable enough to change that. But what the fuck is gonna ignite that?

 I think Coleman can develop into a solid receiver. The problem is the lack of development. It’s unfortunate that Cooper didn’t work out or last, and there aren’t any seasoned WR1s in the room for him to learn from. I’m not losing sleep over Beane’s decisions, but it’s mind boggling how he continues to cherry pick injury prone and aging receivers thinking it will be enough.

The play is doomed before it's played.  This is the difference between having an offensive head coach, or a defensive head coach.

Multiple things here.  We've run a play on second down that picks up enough yards that we think, let's take advantage of them being 'light', and run at them quickly.  But, Miami is ready for it.   Spencer Brown commented after the game that they were not prepared for this type of 'loading the box'. Miami knows we are running left with Cook.

It's not so much they've just overloaded that side, but they're in gaps that we really can't block the play well.  We've telegraphed that we have a run called, because we are hurrying to the line.

They must tell Allen he can't check out of this.  At first I thought the play clock must be winding down, and Allen doesn't have time to change the play, but look, there are 25 seconds on the playclock.

The other reason you call this off, the spot is different than the yardage.  The call upstairs is that we need 2 yards, when the spot is actually for three.

So, this play leads to a three and out.  Our advantage on this play is for Allen to pull the handoff, and go with the pass to the right.  Better yet is doing something that leverages the fact that no one is even over Spencer Brown.  Receivers block down, Brown pulls out to the right, let Allen keep it (sort of what Brown alludes to after the game... let Allen play).

EDIT: I should have explained this better.  When we rushed to the line, Miami was coached...they're running a tush push, line up tight.  They have a man on each side of the center's head, they don't do that the rest of the game.  Dawkins has to kick out on the linebacker, the left guard has to take the first down lineman to his left, the right guard is asked to do an impossible block... YES, you spend a timeout and get out of this.  If Allen has told them to get to the line and run this, most likely the snap is on first sound... so they are stuck in the play.  My point is an offensive coach calls timeout.  YES, spend the timeout.  Running this play is the equivalent of a turnover, because you're not getting the first down.

Punting in that situation killed momentum after that dream scenario of a pick by Bishop.

It's not so much they've just overloaded that side, but they're in gaps that we really can't block the play well.  We've telegraphed that we have a run called, because we are hurrying to the line.

They must tell Allen he can't check out of this.  At first I thought the play clock must be winding down, and Allen doesn't have time to change the play, but look, there are 25 seconds on the playclock.

The other reason you call this off, the spot is different than the yardage.  The call upstairs is that we need 2 yards, when the spot is actually for three.

It feels like Brady has full autonomy on short yardage for some reason. Everything on 3rd/4th and short is some “cute” gimmick that is meant to if it works show that “the OC caught the defense napping”. Idk if this is intentional because Brady is gunning for a HC gig, or if it’s just malpractice, but it really doesn’t have to be tougher in short yardage than allowing Allen the opportunity to read at the line and making the call if it should go to the back, pull the handoff and run, roll to the right for a zone beater 3 yard pass. We’ve overthought this ever since the Chiefs game, it’s like the refs from that game left a permanent trauma in our coaching staff’s brains. No team can cover all 3 options without Allen misreading at the line when we get to 3rd and short, let the man cook.",293258.0,positive

I was hated on back when Buffalo blew the lead against the Texans and I said they’re just a better version of the Marvin Lewis Bengals. Win the division, and make the playoffs, shit even win a game or two but ultimately just blow it with poor play calling and even worse game plans. Buffalo has the players but they’re just out coached by better teams with less talent on the roster. Allen has saved this team’s front office from their glaring failures for too long and thankfully fans are starting to realize it’s not just bad luck but coaching that is Buffalo’s biggest weakness. Unfortunately I can’t think of a better coach that they could acquire. You can’t have the best QB in the league and be satisfied with getting beat in the playoffs every year. I lived through the worst years of Buffalo and that’s why I’m not happy Buffalo hasn’t made it to the Super Bowl.

Dawkins has to kick out on the linebacker, the left guard has to take the first down lineman to his left, the right guard is asked to do an impossible block... YES, you spend a timeout and get out of this.  If Allen has told them to get to the line and run this, most likely the snap is on first sound... so they are stuck in the play.

Given how they get to the line so quickly and run the play right away, it makes more sense that Allen is freestyling and this doesn't come from a call from Brady up in the booth. 

Allen also is not great at read option type plays, seems like he guesses on them and they don't work very often. Same with blitz pass protection. Allen is definitely not known as a cerebral player, a bit of a weakness for an 8th year NFL QB.",79980.0,positive

Josh Allen sat on the bench and stared into oblivion as the Buffalo Bills got bullied by the Miami Dolphins.

Here’s an idea from bytimgraham.bsky.social: Make a call to Brian Daboll, who is suddenly available. People really forgot that McD and Daboll's split wasn't exactly on good terms. Expecting Daboll to come back as OC is, to me, delusion of the highest order.

Willing to bet that the only way he comes back is as HC after cleaning the entire coaching staff out, and I'm not sure I want him as HC.",140063.0,negative

1. Palmer coming back (he looked good in games he played and when paired with Kincaid our offense will look great… when Kincaid healthy)


2 Bishop and Hairston (last few games these two have produced)

3 we have some solid rookies starting on line (deone walker and TJ sanders)

We aren't going to lose another game this season.

This team was built to play in late November, December, and January. People talk a lot of shit about Keon Coleman but I'll bet they become very quiet once there's snow on the ground. James Cook's running style is perfectly suited to the winter, and that Kincaid/Knox/Hawes combo is about to become unstoppable.  

Hairstone has an interception in every game he's played, Bishop is suddenly showing his potential. Benford and Taron will be back shortly.

We have Josh Allen & James Cook on offense, arguably the best QB and RB duo for this season 

Cole Bishop and Maxwell Hariston are keeping our secondary locked down each with 2 INTs on the year so far

Our pass rush has been solid and will be back to normal when injuries are healed 

Our Tight ends have been lighting up our offense this whole season, and come playoff time if we have no more injuries we're gonna look really dangerous. 

I know the current situation feels very doom and gloomy, but more than anything having hope in our team and not giving up on them while there's still football to play and a season to finish is most important.

Matthew Slater, Keshawn Martin, Brandon Lafell, Damarius Johnson, Chris Harper, Leonard Hankerson, Julian Edelman, Aaron Dobson and Danny Amendola. 

Their TE room was just as bad outside of Gronk. 

They leaned on their defense that season. The problem is that Buffalo has a WR room that is just as bad with a QB underperforming and a defense that continually misses starters, so you can't even lean on them to hold leads.

> Recovery will depend on specifics 

> If the MCL is mild (grade 1) or moderate (grade 2) then no surgery is recommended. 

> If the PCL is mild (grade 1) or moderate (grade 2) then no surgery is recommended. 

> If either MCL or PCL is fully torn (grade 3), then he needs season-ending surgery. 

> Grade 3 PCL sprains are pretty rare.

And now he thinks he can take project draft picks on offense and do the same. What he doesn't appreciate is that the odds are stacked against him and the offense because he's a fucking idiot.

Keon Coleman literally eats crayons. He can't find separation. Doesn't understand leverage. And has zero rhythm with Allen.

And McDermott is just a wet blanket. Compare his level of emotion, gumption, zeal, and tenacity to someone like Vrabel and it's all the more apparent that he lacks core leadership capabilities.

The only logical explanation is that he was counting on BIG leaps from Kincaid and Coleman. He was right on Kincaid, but he’s hurt so often that you can’t count on him.

In life, there are times you're going out to a routine restaurant with your family. You're just trying to get out of the house, nothing fancy, looking to kill some time and enjoy your family's company without having to cook or clean. You order something moderately priced off the menu, no need for appetizers, pay for it in cash and get home. 


But then there are times you realize you're in a big city on a once in a lifetime trip. You get invited to a Michelin star restaurant that you know you'll never ever get another chance to eat at. You order the most expensive things on the menu - appetizers, bottle of wine, crazy fancy entree, extravagant dessert, glass of scotch after it all. Throw it on your credit card and say fuck it - I'll worry about it later.

They are old and incredibly slow on defense and the D is further held back deploy a scheme that is MASSIVELY outdated. 

The defense co ti use to be built for the 2000’s/2010’s when half the league now relies on the running game again which is ironic since that’s what their offense relies on now. 

They keep running nickel focus schemes that then rely on safeties to make plays in the 2nd level when you go up against Henry and Achane etc etc. 

The chiefs obsession has gotten so bad we just build for them and have lost sight of the fact we have to actually make the playoffs to beat them there.

 Every single loss our defense has had mistakes, but ultimately what lost those games was the offense

Even our decimated defense that basically only consisted of a 1 handed Bosa, Cole Bishop, and rookie Hairston was handing this offense opportunities to go down and score

I do think we're at a point with injuries where we just can't escape them anymore though. Too many are hurt and too many of the ones gone for the year are key players.

My biggest issue at this point with this team is Joe Brady and what he's scheming

His scheme has run its course and it's beyond predictable. Run on 1st, pass behind the sticks on 2nd, dropback and wait for someone to get open on 3rd, and then punt/1st down. Repeat

The plays are uncreative, and he continuously throws in these dogshit plays like the jet sweep for some reason

It's also impossible for all our receivers to be this consistently covered unless he's just scheming terrible routes for these guys to run

I don't think we have world class receivers, but there's no world where they shouldn't be able to get open like this right now

It's genuinely sad to see how deflated Josh has looked after most games this year, even the wins. I mean we're even at a point where Sean looks frustrated with what he has to work with and he ain't selling the lie that this is a ""championship team""

Just a totally inconsistent team that has seemingly thrown away the year where all the other AFC world beaters are having a down year",82380231.0,negative

 I see plenty of people blaming the receivers but in my eyes it has always been the coaching. 
90% of the bills offensive plays have been give the ball to James cook and hope he gets yards and the rest of the plays are I hope my tight end catches the ball if we do decide to pass. 
There is no team on earth that can win running the ball EVERY first and second down and then doing a predictable pass on third down. They have little to no quick routes for the receivers to work with. Josh has plent of time in the pocket while his o line is constantly getting beat up but they make their WRs run these long ass routes. The bills pick up the most yards when they have short fast routes and actually use their explosive offense. 
The defense is okay. They looks good at times and bad in others but thats because there are so many injuries and the fact that when the offense sucks the defense is playing a majority of the game and that takes a toll on them.",15446293.0,negative

 I apologize if this is a little hard to read but I gotta get this out

This whole season I've never felt that we've gotten a truly great win and we've just been coasting off of Josh Allen being at an MVP level and lifting this team up

I was willing to give this coaching staff a pass last year since they did all of that with hardly anything but it's clear it caught up to us

In a year where we should've went absolutely all in we didn't do anything and lost horribly to the dolphins coming off the deadline where we could've made that move to take us over the top (btw Jakobi Meyers went for a 4th and a 6th and Rashid Shaheed went for a 4th and 5th)

 Our offensive philosophy is good enough for college, that's where Joe Brady should be after this season. I see the organization throwing him under the bus just like they've done with Frasier and Dorsey, and moving on. My biggest worry is that they won't re-hire Daboll if/when NYG let him go. Our offense has been in free fall ever since Dabes left. I'd take him over McDermott. I'd take ANYONE who can coach the offense over what we have now at every level.

Beane let us sit empty handed at the trade deadline, and we findout gameday that it was bc he whiffed on Waddle! That wasnt a shock to the dolphins, they've had it up on their bulletin board all week!

 Good post.

I think we're at a real crossroads this season. It doesn't look like this team can go all the way barring some sort of miracle. With that said, I think this is it for McD. I like him, I really do. He's a wholesome good guy and a good coach, but just not the guy to get us into the promise land and it all really started a few years back in the 13 second game. That was our best team, our year and it was all busted up by a really poor coaching decision. There's been one missed coaching decision after another that has caused us some big losses, most recently yesterday. If the Bills brass doesn't move off from him, I don't know what to say. I've never been a big ""fire everyone"" guy, but its time for a change. Everyone in the league knows this and has been talking about it for some time now.

We need an offensive guy. Fact is, Josh still in his prime, we can have the best of the best pick for a head coach. Anyone who is anyone will be lining up for this job.

Now for Beane. Another I like. He's made some good moves. Of course he drafted Josh when most of the fanbase wanted Rosen. Beane went against the grain and took a risk on Josh Allen and arguably the biggest hit of our beloved franchise. Over the years there has been a mixed bag of draft picks from Cook, Dawkins to big misses like Elam, Coleman, etc. He's taken some big shots like with Diggs who was a big hit for years, but when it comes down to it, our roster just isn't that good. From a big missed opportunity that we desperately needed at the deadline to trying to revive one Panther after another. We're a Josh dependent team who would be bottom tier with any other QB not named Josh. So I'm indifferent with Beane.

If we cleaned house and brought in a new regime with a new plan while Josh still has 5 prime years left, then now is the time to do it before the window starts to close. We have some great pieces that wouldn't take too long, maybe just an offseason and we're back on top.

 Turning the ball over in the red zone is very unusual for the offense and they did it three times. What is even more alarming to me is the lack of mental toughness that I saw against the dolphins who are basically a very bad football team BTW, the Atlanta Falcons, who pushed us around and we made Bijan Robinson look like Derrick Henry five years ago that team has not won a game since they’ve played us and they have not been able to run against anybody since us.

 What I really don't get is this: Everybody Eats DID actually work - last year. Last season the Bills' offense was at or near the top of every offensive stat. So, what the hell happened? It has to be scheme, right? But, has it changed or does everyone read it like an open book now? There is a lot of carry over in personnel from last year. Was Mack Hollins really the game changer for us? Seriously? And that's not a knock on Hollins. As someone on twitter said yesterday - The Jets were able to consistently get the ball to Elijah Moore with Zach frickin' Wilson! Why the hell can't Brady? 

Add to all of that the fact that so many players are playing notably worse than last year. Yes, that starts with Josh. He played great against the Chiefs, but comparing his performance at the midway point of the season now, compared to last year it's pretty obvious. The only player who looks consistent, on offense, from last year is Cook. Kincaid was headed in the right direction, but now who knows. I was excited coming into this year to see where Ray Davis was headed, to now being worried every time he steps on the field. 

On defense, Bernard (a lot), Benford, Johnson are clearly playing worse than last season. 

I have been a consistent defender of this regime, but everything I just typed points to coaching.

 this version of allen is the one we had in dorsey's one year here, that year our WRs couldn't run route properly.  it was such an issue they had to pull cole beasley and john brown out of retirement for the playoff run because no one short of diggs was where they were supposed to be when they were supposed to be there.  particularly woods and mckenzie.

this is josh allen with zero confidence.  he sees a guy he wants to thow to, and he holds it and doesn't throw it because he doesn't expect his guy to win 1 on 1 with the db, or fight for the ball in a 50/50 case, or catch it... or.. they aren't where they're supposed to be when they're supposed to be there.

when josh starts second guessing he looks exactly like he did today.  what's maddening is you can see he has guys he trusts, and guys he doesn't and if the guys he trusts aren't open, he will keep extending the play hoping they get open.  He doesn't trust kurtis samual at all.  on one of the scrambles where he threw the ball out of bounds, he kept looking for knox or kincade (can't recall which)) to get open, but they didn't, samuel had gotten open, about 20 yards downfield heading toward the sideline right where he should be for that scramble.

josh never even looked his way, he kept watching the TE hoping he'd get open, which he didn't and in the end he threw the ball out of bounds.  with Samuel still wide open just standing there on the sideline.

it's not all josh's fault.  in the first quarter on a 3 and out, he tried to get a quick slant in and pulled it back because both WRs running the slant wee walking the route, like legit not running at all.  they were effectivcely not covered.   they weren't trying to sit in a zone, neither even looked at josh, which makes me think they both got the play wrong, or josh got the play wrong.  either way 2 wrs and the qb weren't on the same page on the same play.  that's something i haven't seen since wood and mckenzie back in 23...",2860425.0,negative

 If they don't win a super bowl, tell me that after Stafford retires the Rams don't go after Allen.

 Sorry everyone in advance for this long frustrated rant... We still aren't ready for the ""big time""... In big moments, we still are not playing at ""big time"" level... So much better than the drought years, but we are still not ""there"" yet... Not enough good players at our skill positions + ""B Level"" coaching (as it has always been with this team, even when we had All Pros at all skill positions and even special teams back in the 90s with our Super Bowl runs). I absolutely love Marv, but he wasn't ""A Level""... Marv kept allowing Kelly to throw against a defense specifically designed by Bill Belichick to prevent downfield throws... All while having an All Pro RB who was averaging 9.0 yards per carry (Super Bowl Record) against Belichick's ""genius"" 8 Defensive Back, 3 Down Lineman defense.... Super Bowl 25 was easily winnable, but we had ""B Level"" coaching.... **And we still do**...

Even during the ""Drought Years,"" we often had a group of players ""good enough"" to get to the playoffs, but the low-quality coaches and coordinators we had during that era could never ever get those players in position to win even the ""winnable"" games that could have put us there... This team will very often now pay top dollar for good players but **never ever** for good coaches/coordinators... Coulda had mf'ing Andy Reid in 2013, but he wanted big money so we cheaped out and got friggin Doug Marrone instead (who ironically is now whipping our ass in NE)... :( For a while, we were dominating the regular season with our All World QB Josh Allen, but ""A Level"" coaches and coordinators now have enough film to analyze what Josh and OC Brady really like to do and have now adjusted accordingly... **And our coaching staff has no response to this**... They've hit their ""Ceiling""... Just like Marv and Ted did way back in the day...

Look at the stupid Pats... Their team completely collapsed after Brady left town, and we all celebrated righteously as we slapped them around like the b\*tches they've always been... Now just 5 years later and they're right back to whipping our ass again... Drake Maye has **nowhere near the skill set** that Josh Allen does, but he has ""A Level"" coaching and coordinating behind him... A Championship team has to have **both** skilled players AND coaches, and right now we **don't have enough** of the first, and **none** of the second.

 I made a post last weekend about the signs and symptoms the Bills were having that was going to make for unrecoverable losses if we didn’t change something soon.

I was torn apart by the comments and the mods removed my post for literally zero explanation. Most posts were “we literally just beat Kansas City, you are clearly not a real fan”

This is a fickle fanbase that cannot see the truth right in front of them but only reacts once something goes wrong instead of seeing the writing on the wall and adjusting fire ahead of time. Look no further than yourselves if you want to know what is causing this unpredictability.

This team is not strategizing the way they need and is only being reactionary, leading to chaos and confusion on the field.

The only reason we beat the chiefs is because everyone knew unless they gave it their everything they would get crushed. The coaches went in with a strategy, the offense was calculated, and the defense was dialed in and we won. Next up dolphins - “we will destroy them like we destroyed the chiefs so we don’t need to prepare”…. Every team in the NFL is a professional team. You can’t give anyone an inch. The Bills have been losing to bad teams every time they play down because they aren’t going in prepared like they did with the chiefs or the ravens. 

The Bills owe it to the fans to focus and be dialed in if they really want to win championships. Instead it seems like they only put in effort for games they think they can’t win.",953475.0,positive

The chiefs and eagles have done great finding guys late, we haven't. 

Now the Pats have caught and passed us too..

Maybe in a year or two when some of our younger pieces really hit their stride we might have another super bowl window, but this team as it stands isn't even going to get out of the wildcard.

Yes, I understand he was ""*only* a special teams guy"" but he literally changed the landscape of special teams play forever. He was so good at what he did that ST coordinators had to redesign their entire scheme to compensate for Tasker. The changes they made are still ST staples to this day, 30+ years later.

If I recall, Robert Woods had a breakout game and it went down the wire with Sherman mugging our WR’s on a pass play and not getting a penalty.  But I have no memory of this moment.  

Matt Carpenter gets destroyed by Sherman and the staff comes out to check on him.  Sherman is only given offsides and not a personal foul, and because of the injury, Carpenter was forced to leave the field for a play.  Fortunately there was :03 left, so Buffalo spiked the ball and stopped the clock with :01.  He makes the kick but Buffalo is called for delay of game.  So on the second try Carpenter misses!

So basically Seattle was rewarded for hitting the kicker.  Has this rule been changed, because honestly if this same situation plays out again - why not try to “accidentally” take out the kicker on a long FG attempt?  If the trainers come out, and there’s no TO’s, the kicking team is screwed.   I was at this game, and was beside myself at the time.

People were saying that he didn't hear the whistle, which, maybe?  But he dove right at the kickers knee and didn't hit the ball, so that's a 15 yard penalty even without a whistle?

This was during the hawks heyday, and during the bills nadir, so really it was just fitting of that whole era.  No respect.",422548.0,positive

I think his snaps have been the correct amount when healthy this year. He gives them an element of their offense that causes matchup nightmares. Maybe 1 or 2 linebackers in the league would be able to actually cover him and the second you go nickel when he’s on the field they’ll just run it down your throat.

He's not saying they want to pass to Kincaid more, he's saying they want him on the field without being the primary option because it will open up other players, but is struggling with that and managing his health, which is a perfectly rational take.

With Knox or Hawes on the field, teams don't have to worry about the mismatch as much, and can be more run-biased because of it.  The reality is that Kincaid's health for the playoffs is far more important right now, and as long as we're winning it's crazy to suggest we risk Kincaid's health to boost his stats or to tip our hand on how our play calling might look in the playoffs.",5965.0,neutral

But really, you couldn't find anything to plug an injury hole on the D line? I'd feel much better about the team if Hoecht didnt go down, and if Ed didn't have as bad of an injury. I'd always want a GM that had Josh Allen and James Cook to say they think they can win a Super Bowl, but idk if it's actually realistic.

I think most people expected SOMETHNG given our situation at WR and the DL.  It just seems there wasn't a deal the Bills could do without overpaying. I'm happy Beane has moved us well past the old days of not making the playoffs and did great drafting JA17 and filling out a high performing roster. With that said, he's also whiffed on high draft choices, placed big bets on Diggs and Miller (both of which in hind sight were expensive given production), and has been questionable with some big contracts for guys coming off rookie deals that has handicapped us from a cap space perspective (like Knox and now Rousseau). They're not bad, but they're probably overpaid given their production.

Surly he wouldn’t complain, so <yawn>.

For the first time since we’ve been able to think about a Super Bowl it seems like Beane isn’t building a roster for that, instead to get into the playoffs.

Example- Rapp was injured in camp, and we decided that Hamlin, and Poyer were the answer. They are for the playoffs but for winning a SB. 

Now this inaction in making a trade for a WR, DT, SS etc. good enough to get to the playoffs but not good enough to get to or win the SB.

I can get in on this conversation....

My wife and I flew in from eastern Canada this past weekend for the game. On Saturday we did a wing crawl. We wanted to do 5 spots, but hit the wall at 4. Rules were simple, sauce on using their signature sauce. So here's what we learned....

1. Bar-Bil North - This was really the best. We were so impressed. We used their honey Cajun honey butter (Josh's favorite). Super crispy, good size, tender inside, just the best we've ever had
2. Kelly's Korner - A true dive bar that seems more of a local hangout then us tourists. Never the less, a very close second place. We had the medium sauce which was good but not to the level of the Cajun Honey that BarBil had. The lady serving us was top notch
3. Anchor bar Main st - Seems like a tourist stop. Pretty good wings, but a distant 3rd from Kelly's and BB. Pretty cool spot to visit.
4. Duff's on Dick rd. We loved the bar, caught the ball game there until it closed before the game ended, which was weird. Wings were soggy and we didn't enjoy them. The 2 ladies working the bar were so awesome, we wish we got their names but top notch bartenders! But Last place for sure.

We meant to hit Wingnutz but just couldn't eat anymore. Also missed out on ""Beef on Weck"". For as long as I've been visiting Buffalo for games after all these years, I've never had a Beef on weck. We'll get one next year.

We love Buffalo, such great people who not only made us feel at home, but it feels like our vibe in eastern Canada. See you all next year!

On a side note, what's the deal with all the bars closing at 10-11pm on a Saturday night???????",1586158.0,negative

This has been the story of at least the last 2 seasons. In both of those Chiefs losses, Josh made plays and got the ball to the hands of his receivers. They just dropped it time and again. Meanwhile, the Chiefs stars made plays. Last year, Joe Brady mixed in to take Cook off the field when he was the only offensive player (maybe more than Allen, even, in that game) to be making a consistent impact. Coaching and playmakers.

Ok...so the Colts could not come to agreement on a contract with a Linebacker of the Year Draft...and get signed by a 4-12  Bills Team !

Bill Polian then must be NFL EXEC  of Decade as well then,  going from Hank Bullough ("" we keep beating ourselves, but were getting better at doing it""). To Marv Levy ( "" the Coach that listens to fans winds up sitting next to them"" among others).

So many ""experts"" predicted Chiefs to win yesterday (which is reasonable given how they looked) yet when the Bills win, the dialogue is ""well its only regular season, they can't beat them in the playoffs"".

It's the ultimate lose-lose proposition. No one will seem to care unless we beat them in the postseason, which is fair. But I don't like how they say Bills can't beat the Chiefs ""when it matters"". The regular season clearly matters to get into the playoffs and get seeding in the first place. Don't try to downplay the regular season meetings.

Also if the goal is to win a Super Bowl, 3 of the 4 times KC beat us in the postseason, they didn't even win it all (only won in 2023, the other 2 times they won the SB they didn't play us). And even then, we took the Chiefs to the wire 3 of the 4 times.

when the opposing kicker comes out for a field goal, the whole stadium goes quiet. Everyone starts doing a low, creepy humming noise. Total silence otherwise.

Here's an idea:
- coordinated wave (everyone throws hands in in sync to the side) where 

-- everyone only shouts as we swing from hands from side to side
-- pace gets progressively faster

 ""waah"" (wave left) .......   ""Waah"" (wave right).........  ""waah"" (wave left) .... ""Waah"" (wave right)....  ""waah"" (wave left) .. ""Waah"" (wave right)..

I've been a season ticket holder for 10 years. We can get loud but we really have a fanbase that needs to be hyped up to do so. No recent TDs or just have up a 4th down or something and we're a bit flat. 

I have also been to Arrowhead. They have a very organized fanbase when it comes to getting loud. It gets loud but it's not insane like everyone says. The thing is, they're smart about it. It can be loud and the visiting QB can start signaling to his line or wr or whomever and the Chiefs fans get louder. That's where they do a great job.",13793.0,positive

I was watching the game last night and realized the whole “be loud” thing doesn’t really mess with kickers anymore. It just turns into one big wall of noise. What we need is something that actually throws them off for a second.

Here’s my idea: 

when the opposing kicker comes out for a field goal, the whole stadium goes quiet. Everyone starts doing a low, creepy humming noise. Total silence otherwise. 

Then, the second the ball is snapped, the entire place jumps up and yells BOO at once.

I think it would be fun to have a unique tradition for FGs in Buffalo and would be more likely to throw off the kicker. 

So curious to hear how everyone feels about this and if you have any other wild ideas to get in the kickers head.

Jacksonville’s kicker set a new NFL record for the longest kick yesterday —68 yards.
Being in a dome didn’t hurt.
I was at the Buffalo Bills game yesterday and if it’s perfect weather, opposing kickers usually don’t struggle kicking at Highmark Stadium.
When the place is snowy, rainy and windy, I always hope that will throw off an opposing kicker.
When I am at a game, I yell DROP IT! when Buffalo kicks off or punts to an opposing kick returner hoping he’ll drop the ball on the ground.
Only a couple times did an opposing kick returner dropped and lost the ball after I yelled DROP IT!!! Once against Miami years back, a Dolphins returner dropped and lost the ball and I yelled HE DID!!!
Buffalo recovered the ball. 😂
People next to me laughed and we exchanged high fives!",13793.0,positive

I know I'm going to get downvoted and argued with, but I don't think the narrative that we draft okay talent in the first three rounds is fair. Hear me out. According to Google the hit rate for the first 3 rounds is as follows:

First Round: 56%

Second Round: 33%

Third Round: 20%

A ""Hit"" is a successful pick (e.g., earning a second contract vs. becoming a full-time starter).

Josh, Oliver, Rousseau, Cook, and Kincaid are all great players. You can argue Oliver has been disappointing compared to his draft slot (9th), but he's still a great player. Kincaid needs a little more time to solidify this designation, but I think he's on that trajectory and has at least proven he has the skillset to be great at the NFL level. 

Edmunds, Epenesa, Bernard, and Torrence are all good players. Bernard looked like he could be great, but is trending down. Torrence appears to be trending up. 

Singletary and Zack Moss are/were average players. They filled their roles adequately when they played for us. Not superstars, but I don't think anyone expected them to be. They come from the philosophy that you can draft an adequate RB in rounds 2-4 every few years and not have to pay an RB a premium salary. 

Cody Ford, Boogie Basham, and Kair Elam were clear busts. I'm sure nobody will argue these points. I know everyone hated the Basham pick but I sorta got what Beane was trying to do. We NEEDED to hit on a DE that year and by going back-to-back we increased the chances of that happening. Given the ""hit"" rate defined by Google, that's how things worked out. I know it seems like a waste because the first pick was the hit, but I'm can you imagine if Beane only selected one DE at the top of that draft and it was Basham? Still, he's a bust.

All we have left are players drafted in 2024 and 2025 which I think are too early to judge. DeWayne Carter looks like there is a high probability he'll bust when you combine his rookie year, how the Bills used him during camp, and the injury. But it's still early. I know everyone wants to call Keon a bust, but I think he still deserves more time. On the same token people were calling Cole Bishop a bust but he's starting to look like he's breaking out. Too early to call for either. Hairston has look amazing in his limited time, but 2 games of splitting time is not enough. Same goes for the rest of the new class. 

I think when you take into account what the average hit rate for each round is, Beane has been good to very good in rounds 1-3. He hasn't been the best. He's probably not even Top 5 but solidly Top 10, especially when you consider how well he's done in later rounds. And if 1 or 2 of the younger guys turn into superstars, I think that completely changes the narrative. Now commence the downvotes.",86252.0,positive

Cole fuckin Bishop. Legacy game for him. If he can play like this every game we will have no issues with the secondary. So many clutch pass breakups and tackles. 

Maxwell fuckin Hairston! Second career game coming off IR and being rushed into games with essentially no practice and no camp. Amazing coverage, especially man coverage on Worthy. He's FAST. And very smart. Perfect CB fit for us, fast, smart, ballhawk. INT in his second ever game has to be some kind of record? (Quick Google suggests a handful of rookies have gotten an INT in their first game, and a couple in their second, so not a record but a feat very few players have accomplished). 

Joey Bosa. Amazing game from him, he was in Mahomes' face all night. Only one bad play by him where he had an open lane to Mahomes but pulled back.. I think they tried to trick him and it worked. That was the 4th and 17th. Sucks but he played lights out all night otherwise. 

Michael Hoecht... Man I am devastated. His second game off of suspension and he's been an absolute monster. He looked like he was really going to be THAT guy for us. I really hope Beane can find a good replacement in the next 30 hours.. Why can't we ever have nice things?

Sean McDermott. He has taken over play calling and the defense has been day and night better. Of course the additions of Hairston and Hoecht have helped tremendously, but his defensive play calling has been top notch. No idea what this means for Bobby Babich but I'd like for McD to stay on play calling for now. 

Dalton Kincaid. Boy was he fantastic last night. He played WR1 and crushed it. Somehow he was open deep down the field multiple times and made some big time plays along with a TD. 

Josh Allen. He's back. Those bombs to Kincaid show he clearly hasn't lost a step, just was in a funk. Glad to see him throwing deep again and setting a franchise record for completion %.

Beane, please, I beg you, get us a legit deep threat WR and a replacement for Hoecht or Ed Oliver. Trade a first and a second and a third, fuck it. Go all in, we need to win the big one. Plus Beane finds his gems late in the draft anyway so why bother with early picks? Just trade em.

Also maybe an unpopular opinion but I think the FG was the right call without the benefit of hindsight. Yes, a 3rd/4th down conversion wins the game. But, a FG does too and Prater was close. Also, the Chiefs defense tightens up in situations like that, especially when they need it near the end of the game.

The big takeaways from the game are somehow that Josh is a flopper and the Chiefs got hosed on an intentional grounding (they did but no one acknowledges that we sacked him on the following 3rd down anyway and Mahomes had his worst game statistically and there was no guarantee they would convert what would have been a 3rd and 7)

In his live episode on Friday he answered several listener question about Sean McDermott’s job security.  Here’s a few excerpts of what he had to say.

Regarding the question of Sean McDermott will being fired this season:

“I think that conversation has been like going on outside, and certainly, I'm not immune to seeing what the fan base is talking about. And that has been somewhat of an undercurrent over the past several seasons, I would say. All I can say is this, like it's one thing to have that conversation, but it also has to be based in some sort of reality as to whether or not something is going to happen.

If they don't do what they want to do this year, which is get to the Super Bowl or win the Super Bowl. McDermott has just a lock on this job.

“I get your frustration. I understand the question. I just don't think that it's anywhere close to changing.

So I don't know what, you know, it's a very difficult conversation to even like have, because it's just probably not going to happen. Like 99%, 99.9% chance not going to happen”

He then answered a similar question and had this to say:

““It's... To me, it's not really worth like a heavy consideration when it just doesn't seem to be rooted in reality. So unless something dramatically changes and you hear me talking about it more to where, you know, maybe the tides are turning a little bit, I just, you know, I'm there every day.

I just can't see how that would ever be a consideration at this point in time.”

This is what I’ve always said when it comes to McDermott.  Fans can rant and complain and demand that his firing.  But it’s a waste of energy because it’s just not going to happen.   The full podcast is listed below

In his live episode on Friday he answered several listener question about Sean McDermott’s job security.  Here’s a few excerpts of what he had to say.

Regarding the question of Sean McDermott will being fired this season:

“I think that conversation has been like going on outside, and certainly, I'm not immune to seeing what the fan base is talking about. And that has been somewhat of an undercurrent over the past several seasons, I would say. All I can say is this, like it's one thing to have that conversation, but it also has to be based in some sort of reality as to whether or not something is going to happen.

If they don't do what they want to do this year, which is get to the Super Bowl or win the Super Bowl. McDermott has just a lock on this job.

“I get your frustration. I understand the question. I just don't think that it's anywhere close to changing.

So I don't know what, you know, it's a very difficult conversation to even like have, because it's just probably not going to happen. Like 99%, 99.9% chance not going to happen”

He then answered a similar question and had this to say:

““It's... To me, it's not really worth like a heavy consideration when it just doesn't seem to be rooted in reality. So unless something dramatically changes and you hear me talking about it more to where, you know, maybe the tides are turning a little bit, I just, you know, I'm there every day.

I just can't see how that would ever be a consideration at this point in time.”

I absolutely love what McDermott has done with this team, but come playoff time, this team just can’t get it done. 

The defense just collapses each and every year come playoff time. Josh Allen’s numbers vs the Chiefs in the playoffs  are great, and should have converted to at least one playoff win against them. But time and time again, his specialty fails him.

I don't think he's ""the guy"", but he fixed the culture of the team, and he's stomped the division for the last few years.

Odunze is killing it.


Harrison isn't in a very good situation to thrive, and has better numbers than Coleman, who has Josh Allen throwing him the ball


We all know why Nabers doesn't have big numbers.


Brian Thomas Jr. has better numbers than Coleman and there's rumours the Jags want to trade him.


Nevermind that this doesn't include targets and snap count, which would 100% show that Coleman is treated as the #1 receiver on the Bills.

From the injury report here: [https://www.buffalobills.com/team/injury-report/](https://www.buffalobills.com/team/injury-report/) You’re trying so hard and I really wish I could believe it but I am too objective. I don’t have that thing that most bills fans or sports fans have where I can just ignore objective reality. Mahomes beats us when he doesn’t even have a better supporting cast, he beats us when he does have a better supporting cast, he beats us when he doesn’t get calls, he beats us when he does get calls, he beats us in Kansas City, he beats us in Buffalo. I think Josh is FAR and away 2nd best but I mean it’s literally the most lopsided QB matchup in playoff history. We had the number 1 scoring defense, prime Diggs, and Gabe Davis had maybe the best postseason game a receiver has ever had in NFL history and we still lost. Any analysis you make that says Josh is better is purely theoretical. At a certain point you have to go out there and win it… Mahomes is perfect in have to have it situations in the playoffs. 7 for 7. I have a tattoo of Josh on my leg and I love him so much it literally brings me to tears what Mahomes and KC have done to us. The only way to still be excited is to have that thing that most fans have that allows them to ignore objectivity and believe your own team is special, resilient, and ready to overcome… I just don’t have it. Mahomes has beaten it out of me. (Pause). I’m literally 50/50 on watching the game Sunday they are our daddy. That’s the double sided aspect of sports that makes it so great… objectivity. A scoreboard. People can say all they want but at the end of the day there’s a scoreboard that tells you objectively who’s better. This was actually therapeutic to write out.

> Fowler: Teams I've talked to believe that Meyers has a decent chance to be dealt -- possibly the best chance among available wide receivers. Las Vegas has received interest in the seven-year veteran, and my sense is the Raiders want a strong pick for Meyers. A swap of Day 3 picks won't do at this stage.

> Several teams are believed to be in the receiver market, most notably the Steelers and possibly the Broncos and Bills. Meyers clearly wants out, and the Raiders are in a transitional phase. They just signed veteran Tyler Lockett, which could ease the loss of dealing Meyers. Pittsburgh is keeping tabs on this one but is prepared to be patient, too. If I had to predict a destination right now, I'd say the Steelers.

I don't think it's awful, but I also am not that excited. I'd rather give up premium assets for a stud, rather than day 2 or 3 picks for a decent WR. Would he be out best WR? Yes but he's not night and day different in terms of talent. Idk, just doesn't move the needle much and I doubt we'd be interested in resigning him, unless he goes off in our offense (he won't). So you give up some picks where Beane typically drafts well, to get a rental on a slightly above average WR who will play what, 8 regular season games with us? Seems like a mostly pointless trade. 

If you're going to make a move, make a splash. I'd like to see a real dog on this team or at least a skillet that we don't have. Like game breaking speed or the ability to separate consistently. Myers is a good, maybe great player, but his skillet doesn't differ all that much from Shakir, Samuel or Moore. Granted he's better than all 3, but by how much? Marginally better than Shakir, probably. Meh. I guess if the choice is this or nothing, I'd take this. Sigh",6865.0,positive

Rashid Shaheed would catch 2 passes for 13 yards a game if the Bills traded for him Main thing is Josh is a tick off on everything right now. Faith is that it’ll click eventually, but with his mindset this year let’s just hope & pray. Also tbf Josh missed MVS on two deep post early and they never went back to it, so i’ll give the benefit of the doubt and say Personnel but it’s a combination. The result of the Palmer shot vs ATL tells us enough. 1 We haven’t seen that all year, and 2 a better throw and that’s probably a TD or 20+yds. We know Josh isn’t the best down the field thrower but the threat alone creates more space and that’s the idea. In no world should safeties be able to play at 15-20yds vs Josh Allen. The MVSs of the world aren’t enough. especially when kincaid and palmer are banged up and you’re paying 10m to a gadget guy, but they knew that last year.

While he doesn’t outright trash them he’s not very complimentary.  He also seems to be measured with words.  Almost like he’s thinking “how can I out this nicely without coming off like a jerk.”

Brownie tried to get him to say nice things about the Bills defense.  All he said was that their run fits were better and that Hairston moved well when he was in.   He also praised Hoecht after they promoted him.  

Dan then said that every offensive coordinator will be “hunting” the Bills safeties every play because they are hesitant.  

Offensively he said that Josh played poorly in the first half with reading the field, missing receivers and forcing the ball.  He think he is frustrated after playing poorly for 3 games straight.  He did praise the Bills offensive line, James Cook and surprisingly Reggie Gilliam!  

He then said that missing Josh Palmer is big and that the Bills don’t have anyone else who can consistently win on the outside and get open.  He assumes Beane will be active trying to trade for a 3rd WR.  (not exactly a ringing endorsement of Keon)

Dan normally has been high on the Bills over the past few seasons which is probably how he got his OBD gig.  This year you can kind of tell he doesn’t think as highly with this team.  While he doesn’t outright trash them he’s not very complimentary.  He also seems to be measured with words.  Almost like he’s thinking “how can I out this nicely without coming off like a jerk.”

Brownie tried to get him to say nice things about the Bills defense.  All he said was that their run fits were better and that Hairston moved well when he was in.   He also praised Hoecht after they promoted him.  

Dan then said that every offensive coordinator will be “hunting” the Bills safeties every play because they are hesitant.  

Offensively he said that Josh played poorly in the first half with reading the field, missing receivers and forcing the ball.  He think he is frustrated after playing poorly for 3 games straight.  He did praise the Bills offensive line, James Cook and surprisingly Reggie Gilliam!  

He then said that missing Josh Palmer is big and that the Bills don’t have anyone else who can consistently win on the outside and get open.  He assumes Beane will be active trying to trade for a 3rd WR.  (not exactly a ringing endorsement of Keon)

He then went on about how great Kansas City is and Brownie said he didn’t think they could win without 2 turnovers.  Dan did say you can move the ball on chunk plays on the Chiefs defense and that the Bills will need to win 32 to defeat top teams like Kansas City.  He also sees this as a “must win” to be considered a Super Bowl contender because he thinks they need home field due to communication on the road.   Seems kinda weird for an October game…

It’s not a knock on Dan.  I’d rather see him honest than sugar coat things the way Chris Brown does.  Just surprised to the difference with how he talked about the teams between this year and last.   Everything he said is correct. This team needs to greatly improve to make the playoffs, let alone be a threat to win the SB.

Brownie tried to get him to say nice things about the Bills defense.  All he said was that their run fits were better and that Hairston moved well when he was in.   He also praised Hoecht after they promoted him.  

Dan then said that every offensive coordinator will be “hunting” the Bills safeties every play because they are hesitant.  

Offensively he said that Josh played poorly in the first half with reading the field, missing receivers and forcing the ball.  He think he is frustrated after playing poorly for 3 games straight.  He did praise the Bills offensive line, James Cook and surprisingly Reggie Gilliam!  

He then said that missing Josh Palmer is big and that the Bills don’t have anyone else who can consistently win on the outside and get open.  He assumes Beane will be active trying to trade for a 3rd WR.  (not exactly a ringing endorsement of Keon)

He then went on about how great Kansas City is and Brownie said he didn’t think they could win without 2 turnovers.  Dan did say you can move the ball on chunk plays on the Chiefs defense and that the Bills will need to win 32 to defeat top teams like Kansas City.  He also sees this as a “must win” to be considered a Super Bowl contender because he thinks they need home field due to communication on the road.   Seems kinda weird for an October game…

It’s not a knock on Dan.  I’d rather see him honest than sugar coat things the way Chris Brown does.  Just surprised to the difference with how he talked about the teams between this year and last.   Chris Brown works for the Bills. He is always going to sugarcoat it.
The Bills put ups big numbers against bad teams but have not looked in sync as a total unit all year. 
It is ok to be critical of them. Beane had put together a stinker of a roster in my opinion. Everyone knew these safeties stunk and the WRs were mediocre at best during the off-season here we are almost halfway through the season and those are the glaring issues.",62943.0,neutral

Josh excels at seeing guys in space and rifling it in, he’s never been a back shoulder/jump ball guy. All the WRs he’s thrived with have been separators- Diggs, Beasley, Brown, Sanders etc. 

Keon isn’t going to create a ton of space, it’s just not his game. Throw in all the emphasis on avoiding turnovers and I’m not surprised Josh isn’t throwing a ton of 50/50 balls to him, especially because it hasn’t worked when they’ve tried this year.

The WRs can't separate, so schematically that starts with focusing on Shakir, Kincaid and Cook getting plays designed to get them open, but it also means Josh needs to spend some time in practice testing throwing into tight coverage where only his guy can reach it.

When all you really notice from a rookie CB in his first NFL action is a phenomenal tackle, you know he was doing his job well.

He compared a run the Panthers had to the run that gave up the long Bijan TD. In the latter, Joe was ranting about how it was Ingram's job to at least try to get in Bijan's way enough to slow him down and he couldn't do it, so Bijan got past the 2nd level with a full head of steam.

He will replace Tre White at CB opposite Benford for sure, once he's back in full game shape. I'm a Tennessee fan so watching a lot of SEC I've just seen a lot of tape of him. He really is special. I think late 1st round was a steal on this guy. Now he is an outside zone corner. He's not the best press man guy but if zone works it works. A good HC and DC will play him to those strengths even if everyone else on the field is in man. Just give him the quarter side of the field, ha. 

I'm rambling but enjoy him I don't think OP is comparing him to Sanders based on his CAR snaps, but playstyle that he followed in college and expects will translate",3398.0,negative

Dude—what? The deep post was not open, if he curled the route around the 10 yard line maybe but that was not the route called. That CB has Moore locked down and would 100% make the play on the ball from the 5 yard line and in the end zone. Watch it in slow mo and you see the CB read it perfectly and even turns his hips at the exact right time around the 5 yard line to be exactly step for step with Moore.  Not saying it’s INT but definitely gets batted. You guys are nuts watching this thinking Moore is open. That’s not ‘NFL open’ past the 10 yard line, which was only open bc the DB played it perfectly. 
My bigger concern— what the hell is Josh doing when Kincaid was manhandling the DB for Shakir and when Allen didn’t throw it to him, Shakir could have went down field or across the middle and he picks up easily 7 yards. That’s just a weird play design by Brady and poor decision by Josh to not get it to Shakir. Even if Shakir just stays there, he’s got a blocker and 15 yards between him (behind los) and the next defender. Shakir or Davis could have been good options but Josh just didn’t execute.

Allen has been playing below his standard but this play does not show that. The bubble screen is a decoy. Shavers fake blocks to sell the screen, but the corners and linebacker don't really bite, leaving him blanketed. If Josh throws to Shavers, that ball is intercepted by the lineback. If the linebacker commited to the screen, that throwing lane is wide open. He can't throw it to the corner at the goal line because that isn't the route. By the time Shavers starts to break to the point where he can outrun the outside DB, Josh is off the route.

Moore has inside leverage but Allen doesn't have the room to really step up. That would be an all arm throw, which while we've seen that from Allen, isn't really what you want, and I also think he reset himself too far left, when he came off Shavers, so he'd have to reset again to lead Moore back to the middle of the field. 

The decision to go to the runningback out of the backfield is the right throw here, but because the pocket is collapsing in his face, he is throwing across his body while falling away. If Josh connects, with a good throw, that is a first down and possibly touch down. If Josh tries to reset, it is either a sack, or he gives the curl defender enough time to break on the route for a 3-5 yard gain. 

The reason the middle of the field is open on this play is because of the play design. If Moore cuts in instead of running his route, he's running into the two curl defenders. The reason the middle becomes so open is because both curl defenders play deep for the deep routes. If Kinkaid and Shakir are running routes, then the curl defenders likely don't leave all of that space underneath. 

Somebody said something about Kinkaid being lucky to get get called for a penalty. The line of scrimmage is the 23 yard line. Kinkaid initiates contact at the 24 and then gets pushed back. That is, he was never beyond the line of scrimmage. There is not penalty for his to be called for. That block is clean too. He isn't using the hands or arms to restrict the defenders movement, and he doesn't put hands to the face. 

The play here isn't really the problem for me, the protection just fell apart. I think the other problem is that the defense blitzes away from the screen instead of from the screen side. If the blitz is from the screen side, the Shavers throwing lane is open. The fact the blitz is coming from the backside, means that three of your receivers are out of the play, one as the screen player, one as the screen blocker, and the other as the intended receiver that is triple covered. The two receivers on the backside are running long developing routes, one on a deep post and the other one being the back throwing a block before leaking out on a flat route. If anything Josh would have been better off never even looking for Moore, recognizing that time was up and going right to the flat.",84588.0,neutral

You aren’t wrong that there’s been subpar play from Allen’s standard, but I often think people don’t really understand that the perspective of the All 22 isn’t the same as what someone standing on the field would see. Moore has inside leverage, but he isn’t exactly wide open. And, when you play the video slowly, you can see there is a little bit of traffic in Allen’s face when the pattern breaks.

I read another comment that said at the 7 second mark, Moore is wide open. Yes, but he’s sprinting at that point, without his head being even remotely turned. Just because someone is “open” doesn’t mean it’s the time for them in the pattern. If Allen rips it at 7 seconds, it just hits off of Moore’s body. His pattern was a deep post. Unless it’s an option route, you can’t just hope there’s a telepathic connection to cut the deep post early to a curl or something.",84588.0,neutral

I noticed on slow mo that you can see Torrence is getting pushed into Josh right as he looks at Moore and probably why he didn’t try to throw it right over the top.

I usually love this play and thought that he would get something out of it. Watching it and scrubbing it on my phone makes me realize once again how difficult this job is lol",56392.0,neutral

I think Josh is playing through a hand/arm injury he’s not disclosing. Receivers are getting open by NFL standards, but he’s not taking the shot and is looking for guys he can throw to underneath. This is why a lot of his passes have also been late, causing receivers to have to slow down or reach back to make the catch.",84588.0,negative

Offense:

* Connor McGovern 90.5 grade, second highest among Bills players in week 8.
* Khalil Shakir 88.4 grade, third highest among Bills players. Shakir seems to be the only WR that has any connection with Josh atm.
* Spencer Brown 83.7 grade. He continues to prove Beane right with that extension he gave him after his third year. He's a fundamental part of this offense and I was worried seeing him out there in garbage time (yes, I know they were running away from him thanks to Greg Olsen).
* Reggie Gilliam 73.2 grade. We're using him more and more in those big packages and he's definitely making an impact.
* Ray Davis 52.0 grade. Disappointing season from Ray so far. I think him cutting weight did him a disservice. He doesn't have the explosiveness or agility to be that type of back so he should just lean into the physical between the tackles runner he was in his rookie year.

  
Defense:

* Ed Oliver 84.8 grade to lead all Bills defenders. He's going to be a big loss the rest of the season.
* A.J. Epenesa 80.2 grade. We know he's good for one screen interception every year but even more than that I feel like this has been arguably his best season, very disruptive all around. Contract years are a thing.
* Greg Rousseau 80.0 grade. Just such a steady presence the last few years. I'm glad he's healthier now (bone bruise at the beginning of the year). 
* Maxwell Hairston 77.0 grade. The big one for all of us this week. Max had a great debut both in coverage and as a tackler. 
* Jordan Hancock 67.3 grade in 16 snaps. Really like that we're giving him real snaps now. He could be an answer at safety for years to come.
* Joey Bosa 61.8 grade. Tale as old as time: 80.3 pass rush grade and 50.9 run defense grade. 
* Michael Hoecht 57.5 grade. So this one surprised me a bit but he did get a 76.7 pass rush grade, the main issue is he got a 29.2 tackling grade so I guess he missed a couple of tackles.
* Jordan Poyer 52.3 grade. Not great but compared to Rapp's 44.6 grade for the season, it's an upgrade.
* Javon Solomon 27.9 grade, worst among all Bills players. He's been ineffective all year and I think he's the most likely cut candidate we have if we ever need a roster spot. With the tape he's shown this year I imagine he'll clear waivers and we'll have him back in the practice squad.

 I look forward to these posts haha appreciate you sharing as always.

Max looked stunning yesterday. Came up and made that big hit (which really his tackling was the only knock on him coming out of college) and was great in coverage. Yesterday I think we definitely had a few ""coverage sacks"" which was so encouraging.

Hancock > Rapp

I know it was the Panthers and a backup QB but Panthers o-line is quite solid and they have one of the best rushing attacks and they couldn't even get that going.

Super pumped to see his this unit continues to improve down the stretch and gel.

McDermott please keep playcalling!! Seems like this is a trend every year where he takes over those duties and the unit just instantly improves. For all Sean's shortcomings, he's still one of the best defensive coordinators/minds in the league.",219383.0,neutral

 I think Epenesa's trade value is really high right now. Would like to package him in a deal for either a DT or a WR. 

Can't wait to see the all-22 on Hairston and Hancock. I don't know if we're grooming Hancock for a full transition to safety or if we're going for a Taron replacement and it'll be interesting to see how we lined him up. The only time I remember even seeing Hairston was when he made that tackle, so I want to see if they were not even throwing in his direction. He was on the field almost 50% of snaps and I think they took him out in the 4th when they got rid of the starters, which is a good sign.

 I was saying it in the offseason it’s not like you’re going to find Cook’s yards per contract dollar in the WR market. Cook was a fringe top 5 RB after last season, not going to find a top 5 WR for what, like $12 million or something like that. Barely think you can find a top 20 WR for that much.

Draft is probably the best case to get a really good receiver for cheap. Honestly best case you kinda have to throw darts looking for a truly stand out one unless you’re picking top 10. 2019 last year I can think of where they stumbled on a lot of random day 2/day 3 solid WRs.",16052.0,neutral

* Michael Hoecht 57.5 grade. So this one surprised me a bit but he did get a 76.7 pass rush grade, the main issue is he got a 29.2 tackling grade so I guess he missed a couple of tackles.
* Jordan Poyer 52.3 grade. Not great but compared to Rapp's 44.6 grade for the season, it's an upgrade.
* Javon Solomon 27.9 grade, worst among all Bills players. He's been ineffective all year and I think he's the most likely cut candidate we have if we ever need a roster spot. With the tape he's shown this year I imagine he'll clear waivers and we'll have him back in the practice squad.

 Cook is our most valuable player through 8 games and he’s getting paid 1/4 what Allen is. I know that’s how it works but he’s definitely played up to his contact. I regret saying he seemed like a guy who would get paid and his play would start to deteriorate. If anything Allen is the the deer in headlights. Bring in the mercenary wideout.",5351.0,neutral
1ohiodk,1761665430.0,195,0.98,27,Discuss,"James Cook's contract is looking like an absolute bargain, as he leads all Bills players in Week 8 with a 92.6 PFF grade. Cook is also now PFF's #1 RB through eight weeks. Other interesting/notable grades:

Offense:

* Connor McGovern 90.5 grade, second highest among Bills players in week 8.
* Khalil Shakir 88.4 grade, third highest among Bills players. Shakir seems to be the only WR that has any connection with Josh atm.
* Spencer Brown 83.7 grade. He continues to prove Beane right with that extension he gave him after his third year. He's a fundamental part of this offense and I was worried seeing him out there in garbage time (yes, I know they were running away from him thanks to Greg Olsen).
* Reggie Gilliam 73.2 grade. We're using him more and more in those big packages and he's definitely making an impact.
* Ray Davis 52.0 grade. Disappointing season from Ray so far. I think him cutting weight did him a disservice. He doesn't have the explosiveness or agility to be that type of back so he should just lean into the physical between the tackles runner he was in his rookie year.

  
Defense:

* Ed Oliver 84.8 grade to lead all Bills defenders. He's going to be a big loss the rest of the season.
* A.J. Epenesa 80.2 grade. We know he's good for one screen interception every year but even more than that I feel like this has been arguably his best season, very disruptive all around. Contract years are a thing.
* Greg Rousseau 80.0 grade. Just such a steady presence the last few years. I'm glad he's healthier now (bone bruise at the beginning of the year). 
* Maxwell Hairston 77.0 grade. The big one for all of us this week. Max had a great debut both in coverage and as a tackler. 
* Jordan Hancock 67.3 grade in 16 snaps. Really like that we're giving him real snaps now. He could be an answer at safety for years to come.
* Joey Bosa 61.8 grade. Tale as old as time: 80.3 pass rush grade and 50.9 run defense grade.

Offense

I think Brady is the opposite of Daboll, maybe more like Greg Roman. Great running game but rarely easy button plays. When I watch the Colts or Chiefs, they just seem to have so many easy button plays where guys are wide open. They're not deep passes either.

If Cook isn't on the field, this offense looks lost.

Kincaid's knee officially has me concerned long term, I don't know if he'll ever be a full time player because of it.


Defense

Glad to see them rotating in Hairson and Hancock, I would expect both of them to take more and more reps as the games progress. Hopefully they are both up for it. Hairson looks fast!

Ogunjobi is going to rarely be on the stat sheet, but he's going to be great at keeping LB's clean and playing in position. He's a pain in the ass to play against - Mitch Morris

Benford has not looked good this season, I don't know why, but he's been just OK.

However.

I can't find the clip of it at the moment but there's a perfect play that encapsulates why I feel Josh is off this season. His WR gets wide open because the defender just slips and falls down and josh misses him by a wiiiide margin, throwing the ball out of bounds when his man is insanely open.

-Keon's returning punts now. On its face that's fine, I guess he did that in college? And Shakir returns kicks so it's not like there isn't precedent. But my god he looked LOST out there. With Shakir at least he's got that shiftiness and can get a few extra yards. I really don't know what on earth they're doing with Keon out there.

-Ed Oliver being out for potentially the rest of the season absolutely sucks. Just when we think our defense is looking intact-ish (Milano aside) this happens. Just brutal. EDIT: As I posted this I got an ESPN alert saying that it's a suspected torn bicep and he's out indefinitely. Rest up, big guy.

-Mcdermott is officially sharing defensive play calling duties with Babich. Unofficially I wouldn't be surprised if he took over completely from him.

The one scramble they showed during the broadcast just showed noting open.  He still had the bad Moore toss, but also had two sideline passes that were incomplete because the receivers couldn't get their feet down.  All that to say Allen was one miss and a couple sideline plays away from being 15/19 with 200+ yards.  Not great, but I also suspect that part of the reason Cook was so hot was because the Panthers were trying to really restrict the passing game.

As for defense, apart from Oliver getting hurt, I don't think we could have had a better day.  Hairston was engaged physically, Poyer made a nice tackle in open space that I would have been scared to see Rapp attempt, Hoecht looked great, Walker continued with great penetration, and I don't think Bryce would have made much of a difference.

James Cook is not Dalvin Cook. He is better.,7087752.0,negative

🅱️ One of the games where the complementary football McDermott preaches about showed up. James Cook was spectacular and the defense was solid all day. Hoecht apparently does make a huge difference on that line.

Passing game still leaves a lot to be desired, Josh looked tentative in that aspect but when you put up 40 points you can't complain too much. Still badly need a WR1, that would take us to the next level.",7087752.0,positive

First and last time I ever tried ordering custom sneakers straight from Nike.

Notice the BILLS on the heel is devoid of any color or anything, just the raw leather.

Obviously that’s not what I ordered.

Say Poyer wanted to come back last year at the price tag of this year, would you have him back?

Yes he’s older and slower, but he’s still a presence and gets it. He may be a calming force for Bishop to play better.

I liken it to Moneyball and David Justice. Would he have a .900 ops in Oakland? Nah. But to have a .785 at that age for a reasonable price? Probably worth rostering.

Poyer won’t be a pro bowler, but is he able to do enough to be at or above replacement level? I think so. And if part of that job is to give Hancock some run, even better.

Also, people need to stop worrying about the KC game. We’re probably going to lose it and we need to think more about the bigger picture and just make it to the playoffs first and foremost. We play better with an underdog-and-written-off mentality anyways. Always have. Probably always will.",172527.0,negative

1odayzp,1761151020.0,768,0.85,205,News/Analysis,"[WGR 550] We keep hearing Bills will be ""fine"", but is fine good enough? Jeremy and Joe don't think so.  Anyone else remember like a week ago when everyone was calling the Chiefs dead and their offense looked terrible without their 2 1st round WRs?

They came back and suddenly the Chiefs offense looks really good again.

Presumably Palmer and Kincaid will be back for the offense. Ogunjobi, Hoecht, and Hairston should be returning for the defense.

Who knows how much these guys can really improve the defense but they were some big key offseason acquisitions.

Now maybe if the refs weren’t sandbagging for the Chiefs we would have at least gone to one by now. I’ll even stand 10 toes down on that since someone just mathematically proved it.

If I really want to put the tinfoil cap on, coincidentally just as the Bills were about to run away with the division suddenly we start getting a ton of penalties especially key anytime we get some good Cook runs coming we’ll get a holding call on a snatch trap to wipe out the run and move the Bills back 10 yards.",134477.0,positive

1octplq,1761093851.0,16632,0.9,165,Discuss,"The Buffalo Bills thought they had it figured out, but Josh Allen still can’t do it all 

A pretty good article from from The Athletic (Tim Graham), about how losing back to back games this time feels different than previous seasons (Buffalo has lost two in a row each season since 2020).


These are the main points:


Offense:

After losing to the Patriots, Allen called it “sloppy” and “bad football” and “piss-poor.” Monday night (Atlanta), the Bills punted six times for only the eighth time since the 2019 postseason. They had three possessions to tie the score at 21 in the second half and gained 39 yards.

Complementary football:

Buffalo has held a lead for a whopping 2:47 in the past two games, all of it against New England and never once had the ball while ahead.

Pass protection: 

Allen was sacked 14 times last year. He has already been taken down 12 times, eight over the past three games. Pro Football Reference has charted Allen with a career-low 2.0 seconds of pocket time and 15 scrambles (rushes on plays designed to be a pass), which would put him on pace for 71 this season. His career high was 57 scrambles in 2022.

Discipline:

The Bills have committed 35 penalties, 30 of them accepted for 209 yards. They drew 15 flags against the Patriots and four in the first quarter alone versus the Falcons, including a Gregory Rousseau offside that erased a takeaway and a Tre’Davious White pass interference on a third-down incompletion to extend a touchdown drive. Opponents have accepted at least eight penalties in three straight games, something the Bills haven’t experienced in four years.

Turnover margin:

The one trend everybody knew Buffalo couldn’t count on forever was its kooky 25 consecutive games without a negative turnover margin. Buffalo was a minus-4 combined against New England and Atlanta.

Run defense:

Despite amassing 26 tackles for losses on runs, fourth most in the NFL, they’ve allowed 5.8 yards per carry, with 3.9 yards after contact, both league worsts. Only the Tennessee Titans, who fired their head coach this week, have allowed more than the Bills’ nine rushing TDs.

Open-field tackling:

At safety, Sports Info Solutions has Taylor Rapp down for seven missed or broken tackles and Cole Bishop for three, most comically on Bijan Robinson’s 81-yard touchdown run Monday night. Also, 34-year-old Jordan Poyer is on the field again.

Buffalo’s secondary:

First-round draft choice Maxwell Hairston might be back from his training camp knee injury soon. The blazing cornerback provides no guarantees, having not played an NFL down even in the preseason.
On the 15 balls thrown into White’s coverage, he has allowed 11 receptions (73.3 percent) for 114 yards and a touchdown, while also committing pass interference twice, defensive holding twice and missing four tackles. And he missed a game.
Christian Benford has surrendered an even higher passer rating, 18 of 28 attempts (64.3 percent) for 174 yards and four touchdowns with a pass interference, a defensive hold and an illegal contact

Wide Receivers:

Coleman has been invisible at times and did something off-field to make McDermott bench him for the first series of the New England loss. Coleman fumbled away his first catch in that game, at Buffalo’s 10-yard line, gifting New England a free field goal in a three-point game.
The next day, McDermott acknowledged Coleman “has shown growth this year.” If that’s the case, then how truly immature was the player they drafted 33rd overall? McDermott last year benched Coleman for the first quarter of his third NFL game. Twenty-three games are too soon to declare anything, but Coleman already has a grimacing reputation to shake. Veteran receivers Curtis Samuel and Elijah Moore have been healthy scratches already. Newcomer Joshua Palmer hasn’t clicked so far, and now he’s hurt.
So are Kincaid and eleventy-three others. McDermott, as was the case with Ken Dorsey and Brian Daboll before, has shown frustrations with offensive coordinator Joe Brady for being “too cute” and not using Cook enough — the same Cook who scored 18 touchdowns last year but Beane was reluctant to extend and who some daffy fans weren’t too worried about replacing with, say, Frank Gore Jr.

Beane:

Beane was so cocksure Allen’s solo act would work again that the GM made only minor moves to improve the offense. Beane even seemed willing to let running back James Cook walk in 2026.
In a post-draft interview on the Bills’ flagship radio station WGR 550-AM, Beane lashed out at the hosts for criticizing his lack of attention to wide receiver throughout the offseason. The club thought Beane was righteous and entertaining enough to feature his rant — that the Bills even had to bleep — at the very beginning of their behind-the-scenes draft special. The Bills didn’t lead with material about the rookies they drafted; they wanted to ridicule.
Through six games, the receiver criticism looks legitimate. The highest draft picks haven’t made an impact, and receiver production has been negligible.
Almost a year ago to the day, with concerns over the wideouts and the Bills coming off back-to-back losses, Beane traded for Amari Cooper, and although the five-time Pro Bowl receiver didn’t light up the stat sheet, his presence was credited for opening up the offense.
To make a similar deal now, of course, would require Beane to admit he was wrong this offseason.
As much as fans are losing patience with Beane, his job is not on the line — not as long as Terry Pegula, who also owns the pitiful Buffalo Sabres, maintains peace of mind that at least one of his teams has competent leadership.


The Bills might not lose consecutive games again this year. They should win more games than they lose. The playoffs are nearly assured.
Buffalo probably will pull out of this funk, but what then? In their roles, Beane and McDermott own the highest regular-season winning percentages in club history by a lot — and there’s the rub.
The regular-season victories will keep coming and they will keep thinking they’ve got it all figured out.
Historically, that’s what this Buffalo Bills era has been good at.





 I really like that end section.

McDermott and Beane are insanely cocky (this proven by Beane going onto WGR and being a bitch), because they have all this regular season success, because of Josh Allen.

These two don’t realize their careers are only stable because of Josh Allen, the regular season success has nothing to do with either of them, Josh drags McDermotts terrible schemes to wins while also doing that with the JAGS Beane gives him. 

They’re complacent because they know Josh will save their asses in the regular season and are just hoping Josh becomes second coming of Jesus and wins the SB for them. Beane especially has no idea what the hell he’s doing, and McDermott is just complacent and never bothers to hire outside the organization anymore.",2484821.0,neutral

A pretty good article from from The Athletic (Tim Graham), about how losing back to back games this time feels different than previous seasons (Buffalo has lost two in a row each season since 2020).


These are the main points:


Offense:

After losing to the Patriots, Allen called it “sloppy” and “bad football” and “piss-poor.” Monday night (Atlanta), the Bills punted six times for only the eighth time since the 2019 postseason. They had three possessions to tie the score at 21 in the second half and gained 39 yards.

Complementary football:

Buffalo has held a lead for a whopping 2:47 in the past two games, all of it against New England and never once had the ball while ahead.

Pass protection: 

Allen was sacked 14 times last year. He has already been taken down 12 times, eight over the past three games. Pro Football Reference has charted Allen with a career-low 2.0 seconds of pocket time and 15 scrambles (rushes on plays designed to be a pass), which would put him on pace for 71 this season. His career high was 57 scrambles in 2022.

Discipline:

The Bills have committed 35 penalties, 30 of them accepted for 209 yards. They drew 15 flags against the Patriots and four in the first quarter alone versus the Falcons, including a Gregory Rousseau offside that erased a takeaway and a Tre’Davious White pass interference on a third-down incompletion to extend a touchdown drive. Opponents have accepted at least eight penalties in three straight games, something the Bills haven’t experienced in four years.

Turnover margin:

The one trend everybody knew Buffalo couldn’t count on forever was its kooky 25 consecutive games without a negative turnover margin. Buffalo was a minus-4 combined against New England and Atlanta.

Run defense:

Despite amassing 26 tackles for losses on runs, fourth most in the NFL, they’ve allowed 5.8 yards per carry, with 3.9 yards after contact, both league worsts. Only the Tennessee Titans, who fired their head coach this week, have allowed more than the Bills’ nine rushing TDs.

Open-field tackling:

At safety, Sports Info Solutions has Taylor Rapp down for seven missed or broken tackles and Cole Bishop for three, most comically on Bijan Robinson’s 81-yard touchdown run Monday night. Also, 34-year-old Jordan Poyer is on the field again.

Buffalo’s secondary:

First-round draft choice Maxwell Hairston might be back from his training camp knee injury soon. The blazing cornerback provides no guarantees, having not played an NFL down even in the preseason.
On the 15 balls thrown into White’s coverage, he has allowed 11 receptions (73.3 percent) for 114 yards and a touchdown, while also committing pass interference twice, defensive holding twice and missing four tackles. And he missed a game.
Christian Benford has surrendered an even higher passer rating, 18 of 28 attempts (64.3 percent) for 174 yards and four touchdowns with a pass interference, a defensive hold and an illegal contact

Wide Receivers:

Coleman has been invisible at times and did something off-field to make McDermott bench him for the first series of the New England loss. Coleman fumbled away his first catch in that game, at Buffalo’s 10-yard line, gifting New England a free field goal in a three-point game.
The next day, McDermott acknowledged Coleman “has shown growth this year.” If that’s the case, then how truly immature was the player they drafted 33rd overall? McDermott last year benched Coleman for the first quarter of his third NFL game. Twenty-three games are too soon to declare anything, but Coleman already has a grimacing reputation to shake. Veteran receivers Curtis Samuel and Elijah Moore have been healthy scratches already. Newcomer Joshua Palmer hasn’t clicked so far, and now he’s hurt.
So are Kincaid and eleventy-three others. McDermott, as was the case with Ken Dorsey and Brian Daboll before, has shown frustrations with offensive coordinator Joe Brady for being “too cute” and not using Cook enough — the same Cook who scored 18 touchdowns last year but Beane was reluctant to extend and who some daffy fans weren’t too worried about replacing with, say, Frank Gore Jr.

Beane:

Beane was so cocksure Allen’s solo act would work again that the GM made only minor moves to improve the offense. Beane even seemed willing to let running back James Cook walk in 2026.
In a post-draft interview on the Bills’ flagship radio station WGR 550-AM, Beane lashed out at the hosts for criticizing his lack of attention to wide receiver throughout the offseason. The club thought Beane was righteous and entertaining enough to feature his rant — that the Bills even had to bleep — at the very beginning of their behind-the-scenes draft special. The Bills didn’t lead with material about the rookies they drafted; they wanted to ridicule.
Through six games, the receiver criticism looks legitimate. The highest draft picks haven’t made an impact, and receiver production has been negligible.
Almost a year ago to the day, with concerns over the wideouts and the Bills coming off back-to-back losses, Beane traded for Amari Cooper, and although the five-time Pro Bowl receiver didn’t light up the stat sheet, his presence was credited for opening up the offense.
To make a similar deal now, of course, would require Beane to admit he was wrong this offseason.
As much as fans are losing patience with Beane, his job is not on the line — not as long as Terry Pegula, who also owns the pitiful Buffalo Sabres, maintains peace of mind that at least one of his teams has competent leadership.


The Bills might not lose consecutive games again this year. They should win more games than they lose. The playoffs are nearly assured.
Buffalo probably will pull out of this funk, but what then? In their roles, Beane and McDermott own the highest regular-season winning percentages in club history by a lot — and there’s the rub.
The regular-season victories will keep coming and they will keep thinking they’ve got it all figured out.
Historically, that’s what this Buffalo Bills era has been good at.

Opponents have accepted at least eight penalties in three straight games, something the Bills haven’t experienced in four years.

Turnover margin:

The one trend everybody knew Buffalo couldn’t count on forever was its kooky 25 consecutive games without a negative turnover margin. Buffalo was a minus-4 combined against New England and Atlanta.

Run defense:

Despite amassing 26 tackles for losses on runs, fourth most in the NFL, they’ve allowed 5.8 yards per carry, with 3.9 yards after contact, both league worsts. Only the Tennessee Titans, who fired their head coach this week, have allowed more than the Bills’ nine rushing TDs.

Open-field tackling:

At safety, Sports Info Solutions has Taylor Rapp down for seven missed or broken tackles and Cole Bishop for three, most comically on Bijan Robinson’s 81-yard touchdown run Monday night. Also, 34-year-old Jordan Poyer is on the field again.

Buffalo’s secondary:

First-round draft choice Maxwell Hairston might be back from his training camp knee injury soon. The blazing cornerback provides no guarantees, having not played an NFL down even in the preseason.
On the 15 balls thrown into White’s coverage, he has allowed 11 receptions (73.3 percent) for 114 yards and a touchdown, while also committing pass interference twice, defensive holding twice and missing four tackles. And he missed a game.
Christian Benford has surrendered an even higher passer rating, 18 of 28 attempts (64.3 percent) for 174 yards and four touchdowns with a pass interference, a defensive hold and an illegal contact

Wide Receivers:

Coleman has been invisible at times and did something off-field to make McDermott bench him for the first series of the New England loss. Coleman fumbled away his first catch in that game, at Buffalo’s 10-yard line, gifting New England a free field goal in a three-point game.
The next day, McDermott acknowledged Coleman “has shown growth this year.” If that’s the case, then how truly immature was the player they drafted 33rd overall? McDermott last year benched Coleman for the first quarter of his third NFL game. Twenty-three games are too soon to declare anything, but Coleman already has a grimacing reputation to shake. Veteran receivers Curtis Samuel and Elijah Moore have been healthy scratches already. Newcomer Joshua Palmer hasn’t clicked so far, and now he’s hurt.
So are Kincaid and eleventy-three others. McDermott, as was the case with Ken Dorsey and Brian Daboll before, has shown frustrations with offensive coordinator Joe Brady for being “too cute” and not using Cook enough — the same Cook who scored 18 touchdowns last year but Beane was reluctant to extend and who some daffy fans weren’t too worried about replacing with, say, Frank Gore Jr.

Beane:

Beane was so cocksure Allen’s solo act would work again that the GM made only minor moves to improve the offense. Beane even seemed willing to let running back James Cook walk in 2026.
In a post-draft interview on the Bills’ flagship radio station WGR 550-AM, Beane lashed out at the hosts for criticizing his lack of attention to wide receiver throughout the offseason. The club thought Beane was righteous and entertaining enough to feature his rant — that the Bills even had to bleep — at the very beginning of their behind-the-scenes draft special. The Bills didn’t lead with material about the rookies they drafted; they wanted to ridicule.
Through six games, the receiver criticism looks legitimate. The highest draft picks haven’t made an impact, and receiver production has been negligible.
Almost a year ago to the day, with concerns over the wideouts and the Bills coming off back-to-back losses, Beane traded for Amari Cooper, and although the five-time Pro Bowl receiver didn’t light up the stat sheet, his presence was credited for opening up the offense.
To make a similar deal now, of course, would require Beane to admit he was wrong this offseason.
As much as fans are losing patience with Beane, his job is not on the line — not as long as Terry Pegula, who also owns the pitiful Buffalo Sabres, maintains peace of mind that at least one of his teams has competent leadership.


The Bills might not lose consecutive games again this year. They should win more games than they lose. The playoffs are nearly assured.
Buffalo probably will pull out of this funk, but what then? In their roles, Beane and McDermott own the highest regular-season winning percentages in club history by a lot — and there’s the rub.
The regular-season victories will keep coming and they will keep thinking they’ve got it all figured out.
Historically, that’s what this Buffalo Bills era has been good at.





 After this many years, in the playoffs when it counts, when will McDermott pick up his end of the couch and have his defense actually stop somebody?

A pretty good article from from The Athletic (Tim Graham), about how losing back to back games this time feels different than previous seasons (Buffalo has lost two in a row each season since 2020).


These are the main points:


Offense:

After losing to the Patriots, Allen called it “sloppy” and “bad football” and “piss-poor.” Monday night (Atlanta), the Bills punted six times for only the eighth time since the 2019 postseason. They had three possessions to tie the score at 21 in the second half and gained 39 yards.

Complementary football:

Buffalo has held a lead for a whopping 2:47 in the past two games, all of it against New England and never once had the ball while ahead.

Pass protection: 

Allen was sacked 14 times last year. He has already been taken down 12 times, eight over the past three games. Pro Football Reference has charted Allen with a career-low 2.0 seconds of pocket time and 15 scrambles (rushes on plays designed to be a pass), which would put him on pace for 71 this season. His career high was 57 scrambles in 2022.

Discipline:

The Bills have committed 35 penalties, 30 of them accepted for 209 yards.

 Beane and McDermott may own the reg season winning percentage, but never under them have i felt like the bestvteam in the AFC.

Under Polian and Levy i felt that.

Christian Benford has surrendered an even higher passer rating, 18 of 28 attempts (64.3 percent) for 174 yards and four touchdowns with a pass interference, a defensive hold and an illegal contact

Wide Receivers:

Coleman has been invisible at times and did something off-field to make McDermott bench him for the first series of the New England loss. Coleman fumbled away his first catch in that game, at Buffalo’s 10-yard line, gifting New England a free field goal in a three-point game.
The next day, McDermott acknowledged Coleman “has shown growth this year.” If that’s the case, then how truly immature was the player they drafted 33rd overall? McDermott last year benched Coleman for the first quarter of his third NFL game. Twenty-three games are too soon to declare anything, but Coleman already has a grimacing reputation to shake. Veteran receivers Curtis Samuel and Elijah Moore have been healthy scratches already. Newcomer Joshua Palmer hasn’t clicked so far, and now he’s hurt.
So are Kincaid and eleventy-three others. McDermott, as was the case with Ken Dorsey and Brian Daboll before, has shown frustrations with offensive coordinator Joe Brady for being “too cute” and not using Cook enough — the same Cook who scored 18 touchdowns last year but Beane was reluctant to extend and who some daffy fans weren’t too worried about replacing with, say, Frank Gore Jr.

Beane:

Beane was so cocksure Allen’s solo act would work again that the GM made only minor moves to improve the offense. Beane even seemed willing to let running back James Cook walk in 2026.
In a post-draft interview on the Bills’ flagship radio station WGR 550-AM, Beane lashed out at the hosts for criticizing his lack of attention to wide receiver throughout the offseason. The club thought Beane was righteous and entertaining enough to feature his rant — that the Bills even had to bleep — at the very beginning of their behind-the-scenes draft special. The Bills didn’t lead with material about the rookies they drafted; they wanted to ridicule.
Through six games, the receiver criticism looks legitimate. The highest draft picks haven’t made an impact, and receiver production has been negligible.
Almost a year ago to the day, with concerns over the wideouts and the Bills coming off back-to-back losses, Beane traded for Amari Cooper, and although the five-time Pro Bowl receiver didn’t light up the stat sheet, his presence was credited for opening up the offense.
To make a similar deal now, of course, would require Beane to admit he was wrong this offseason.
As much as fans are losing patience with Beane, his job is not on the line — not as long as Terry Pegula, who also owns the pitiful Buffalo Sabres, maintains peace of mind that at least one of his teams has competent leadership.


The Bills might not lose consecutive games again this year. They should win more games than they lose. The playoffs are nearly assured.
Buffalo probably will pull out of this funk, but what then? In their roles, Beane and McDermott own the highest regular-season winning percentages in club history by a lot — and there’s the rub.
The regular-season victories will keep coming and they will keep thinking they’ve got it all figured out.
Historically, that’s what this Buffalo Bills era has been good at.





 The penalties have been really frustrating. So many drives the last few weeks that have been stalled due to penalties. 

The play calling and scheme has been bad. Dudes don’t get open.

A pretty good article from from The Athletic (Tim Graham), about how losing back to back games this time feels different than previous seasons (Buffalo has lost two in a row each season since 2020).


These are the main points:


Offense:

After losing to the Patriots, Allen called it “sloppy” and “bad football” and “piss-poor.” Monday night (Atlanta), the Bills punted six times for only the eighth time since the 2019 postseason. They had three possessions to tie the score at 21 in the second half and gained 39 yards.

Complementary football:

Buffalo has held a lead for a whopping 2:47 in the past two games, all of it against New England and never once had the ball while ahead.

Pass protection: 

Allen was sacked 14 times last year. He has already been taken down 12 times, eight over the past three games. Pro Football Reference has charted Allen with a career-low 2.0 seconds of pocket time and 15 scrambles (rushes on plays designed to be a pass), which would put him on pace for 71 this season. His career high was 57 scrambles in 2022.

Discipline:

The Bills have committed 35 penalties, 30 of them accepted for 209 yards. They drew 15 flags against the Patriots and four in the first quarter alone versus the Falcons, including a Gregory Rousseau offside that erased a takeaway and a Tre’Davious White pass interference on a third-down incompletion to extend a touchdown drive. Opponents have accepted at least eight penalties in three straight games, something the Bills haven’t experienced in four years.

Turnover margin:

The one trend everybody knew Buffalo couldn’t count on forever was its kooky 25 consecutive games without a negative turnover margin. Buffalo was a minus-4 combined against New England and Atlanta.

Run defense:

Despite amassing 26 tackles for losses on runs, fourth most in the NFL, they’ve allowed 5.8 yards per carry, with 3.9 yards after contact, both league worsts. Only the Tennessee Titans, who fired their head coach this week, have allowed more than the Bills’ nine rushing TDs.

Open-field tackling:

At safety, Sports Info Solutions has Taylor Rapp down for seven missed or broken tackles and Cole Bishop for three, most comically on Bijan Robinson’s 81-yard touchdown run Monday night. Also, 34-year-old Jordan Poyer is on the field again.

 It’s actually really sad the state we’re in right now. This team as constructed clearly can’t even get to a Super Bowl, let alone win one. Going in to each season we have one of the biggest advantages because we have Josh. But because we’re happy with just being relevant again and we have greedy billionaire owners that ultimately don’t care about winning nearly as much as the bottom line, we’ll never seriously contend for championships.

 It really doesn't feel much different.

Shit, does anyone *remember* last year and the discourse after the Baltimore blowout and the Houston game where Josh went 9-for-30 passing? If anything, that felt worse!

And that team figured it out and ended up with the ball and a chance to win in the AFC Championship Game. 

No one is dumb for being concerned or thinking McDermott and Beane might have taken this as far as it will go with them in charge...but acting like this team is hopeless and can't or won't figure it out is silly. They've basically followed this pattern for years now: hot start -> mid-season swoon -> panic -> excellent December.

Christian Benford has surrendered an even higher passer rating, 18 of 28 attempts (64.3 percent) for 174 yards and four touchdowns with a pass interference, a defensive hold and an illegal contact

Wide Receivers:

Coleman has been invisible at times and did something off-field to make McDermott bench him for the first series of the New England loss. Coleman fumbled away his first catch in that game, at Buffalo’s 10-yard line, gifting New England a free field goal in a three-point game.
The next day, McDermott acknowledged Coleman “has shown growth this year.” If that’s the case, then how truly immature was the player they drafted 33rd overall? McDermott last year benched Coleman for the first quarter of his third NFL game. Twenty-three games are too soon to declare anything, but Coleman already has a grimacing reputation to shake. Veteran receivers Curtis Samuel and Elijah Moore have been healthy scratches already. Newcomer Joshua Palmer hasn’t clicked so far, and now he’s hurt.
So are Kincaid and eleventy-three others. McDermott, as was the case with Ken Dorsey and Brian Daboll before, has shown frustrations with offensive coordinator Joe Brady for being “too cute” and not using Cook enough — the same Cook who scored 18 touchdowns last year but Beane was reluctant to extend and who some daffy fans weren’t too worried about replacing with, say, Frank Gore Jr.

Beane:

Beane was so cocksure Allen’s solo act would work again that the GM made only minor moves to improve the offense. Beane even seemed willing to let running back James Cook walk in 2026.
In a post-draft interview on the Bills’ flagship radio station WGR 550-AM, Beane lashed out at the hosts for criticizing his lack of attention to wide receiver throughout the offseason. The club thought Beane was righteous and entertaining enough to feature his rant — that the Bills even had to bleep — at the very beginning of their behind-the-scenes draft special. The Bills didn’t lead with material about the rookies they drafted; they wanted to ridicule.
Through six games, the receiver criticism looks legitimate. The highest draft picks haven’t made an impact, and receiver production has been negligible.
Almost a year ago to the day, with concerns over the wideouts and the Bills coming off back-to-back losses, Beane traded for Amari Cooper, and although the five-time Pro Bowl receiver didn’t light up the stat sheet, his presence was credited for opening up the offense.
To make a similar deal now, of course, would require Beane to admit he was wrong this offseason.
As much as fans are losing patience with Beane, his job is not on the line — not as long as Terry Pegula, who also owns the pitiful Buffalo Sabres, maintains peace of mind that at least one of his teams has competent leadership.


The Bills might not lose consecutive games again this year. They should win more games than they lose. The playoffs are nearly assured.
Buffalo probably will pull out of this funk, but what then? In their roles, Beane and McDermott own the highest regular-season winning percentages in club history by a lot — and there’s the rub.
The regular-season victories will keep coming and they will keep thinking they’ve got it all figured out.
Historically, that’s what this Buffalo Bills era has been good at.

If youbhave Bills gear, or a Bills tattoo, I am approaching you and casually saying ""Go Bills."" Here are the results:

Monday - Magic Kingdom - 3/3 - 100% and a nice conversation with a guy that ended with a classic FTP

Tuesday - EPCOT - 2/5 - 40%. A lot of fraudulent fans???? A low-light was when when a guy responded to GB with a ""huh??"" I followed up with a reliable ""where else would you rather be??"" And got a ""uhh ok"" and he walked away. Guy was not with a family and had a division champs shirt from 2024.

So through 2 quarters, we are 5/8 = 62.5% . This is not how we prove we are a great fan base. Last year this same test resulted in a score over 90%

Tomorrow we gotta pick it up people!!!

Every year the roster sucks, is another year of Allen wasted. Allen is at worst the 2nd best QB of his era and the guy he’s chasing has a GM giving him weapons galore now.

The Miami Dolphins were undefeated and averaging a blistering 43 points per game. They had just obliterated the Denver Broncos 70-20, even passing up the chance to break the single-game scoring record.

The talking heads on ESPN (Dan Orlavsky pops in my mind) declared Miami’s offense “unstoppable” and “revolutionary.” Dolphins fans were already discussing MVP, Coach of the Year, and yes… a Super Bowl (finally!). The man at the helm was an unconventional wunderkind, Mike McDaniel, hailed as an offensive genius. The Dolphins themselves were sharing the thinking emoji on social media…a smug, modern retort of ""how about them Dolphins!""

And then the Buffalo Bills happened.

Rather than the game being a changing of the guard, Miami was exposed by Bills coach Sean McDermott. He seemed to have written the blueprint on how to defend the Mike McDaniel offense: Play two-high safeties, take away the first read, pressure the immobile Tua (who had recently gained 20+ pounds to protect from injury), and play physical on both sides of the ball. It was a 48-20 laugher.  The key, McDermott seemed to realize, was that while Miami was incredibly fast and athletic, if you played them very physical they weren't going to punch back. Much like the jock who stuffed the meek nerd into a locker in a 1980s comedy, McDermott exposed the limits of McDaniel’s “genius.”

The best part of the win, was the photo of Josh ironically mocking the famous thinking emoji from earlier in the week.  

That season, Miami continued to beat up on less-talented teams, but every time they played a quality opponent, their foe borrowed the same blueprint to slow down the offense and then some. 

The team once predicted to win the Super Bowl ended up getting eliminated in a brutal cold-weather game because they were, quite simply… too soft.
In subsequent seasons, McDaniel tried to counter by developing an innovative running and short passing game. He saw some success, but his offensive line really had no nasty “dudes” and neither did the defense.  They needed Richie Incognito’s and instead got Larry Borom’s.  Moreover, this style of football neutered the big-play potential the offense once had.

How about those Dolphins?” We have the answer - they were the same as the old Dolphins.   Can we stop trying to take credit for every team's collapse? First Baltimore and now Miami?

The Miami Dolphins were undefeated and averaging a blistering 43 points per game. They had just obliterated the Denver Broncos 70-20, even passing up the chance to break the single-game scoring record.

The talking heads on ESPN (Dan Orlavsky pops in my mind) declared Miami’s offense “unstoppable” and “revolutionary.” Dolphins fans were already discussing MVP, Coach of the Year, and yes… a Super Bowl (finally!). The man at the helm was an unconventional wunderkind, Mike McDaniel, hailed as an offensive genius. The Dolphins themselves were sharing the thinking emoji on social media…a smug, modern retort of ""how about them Dolphins!""

And then the Buffalo Bills happened.

Rather than the game being a changing of the guard, Miami was exposed by Bills coach Sean McDermott. He seemed to have written the blueprint on how to defend the Mike McDaniel offense: Play two-high safeties, take away the first read, pressure the immobile Tua (who had recently gained 20+ pounds to protect from injury), and play physical on both sides of the ball. It was a 48-20 laugher.  The key, McDermott seemed to realize, was that while Miami was incredibly fast and athletic, if you played them very physical they weren't going to punch back.

The Miami Dolphins were undefeated and averaging a blistering 43 points per game. They had just obliterated the Denver Broncos 70-20, even passing up the chance to break the single-game scoring record.

The talking heads on ESPN (Dan Orlavsky pops in my mind) declared Miami’s offense “unstoppable” and “revolutionary.” Dolphins fans were already discussing MVP, Coach of the Year, and yes… a Super Bowl (finally!). The man at the helm was an unconventional wunderkind, Mike McDaniel, hailed as an offensive genius. The Dolphins themselves were sharing the thinking emoji on social media…a smug, modern retort of ""how about them Dolphins!""

And then the Buffalo Bills happened.

Rather than the game being a changing of the guard, Miami was exposed by Bills coach Sean McDermott. He seemed to have written the blueprint on how to defend the Mike McDaniel offense: Play two-high safeties, take away the first read, pressure the immobile Tua (who had recently gained 20+ pounds to protect from injury), and play physical on both sides of the ball. It was a 48-20 laugher.  The key, McDermott seemed to realize, was that while Miami was incredibly fast and athletic, if you played them very physical they weren't going to punch back. Much like the jock who stuffed the meek nerd into a locker in a 1980s comedy, McDermott exposed the limits of McDaniel’s “genius.”

The best part of the win, was the photo of Josh ironically mocking the famous thinking emoji from earlier in the week.  

That season, Miami continued to beat up on less-talented teams, but every time they played a quality opponent, their foe borrowed the same blueprint to slow down the offense and then some. 

The team once predicted to win the Super Bowl ended up getting eliminated in a brutal cold-weather game because they were, quite simply… too soft.
In subsequent seasons, McDaniel tried to counter by developing an innovative running and short passing game. He saw some success, but his offensive line really had no nasty “dudes” and neither did the defense.  They needed Richie Incognito’s and instead got Larry Borom’s.  Moreover, this style of football neutered the big-play potential the offense once had.

So when you look back at the high point of the Mike McDaniel as head coach, just know the downfall started on that warm October day in Buffalo.

I'm doing the same thing...one card for every year. I like color matches in particular. Still need to get 2022 and 2024 slabbed. Ideally all 10's, so currently seeking an upgrade on the RC.

The security let me deliver the drinks, I used that as an opportunity to shake his hand tell him how much of a fan I am. He signed my jersey and thanked me for the drinks. Really great dude! As a collector, there are many types of cards, and prices can vary a lot. Generally, the more common a card is, the cheaper it will be. Cards also come in different “variations” with unique designs or colors—rarer or visually striking variations usually cost more.

Some of the rarest cards are called “1 of 1s” or numbered cards. A 1 of 1 means only one copy exists. Numbered cards are limited to a set number (e.g., /25, /99) and only that many were made. These cards are naturally going to be rarer and more sought after - thus expensiver.

Rookie cards are usually the most sought-after. For Josh Allen, the most popular are his rated rookie cards. Be careful with “chasers”—they aren’t actual cards but just a chance to pull one.

Some cards are sold in slabs with grades. Higher grades mean better condition, centering, and overall quality. Graded cards are guaranteed authentic, but buying ungraded cards is fine too if you inspect the images and understand possible flaws. Buying from reputable sellers or card shops is always safer.

College-uniform cards tend to be cheaper if you’re looking for something more affordable. On eBay, you can search by “Josh Allen 2018 rookie card” and filter by price range.

Regarding long-term value, cards often peak when the player achieves something significant, like setting records, winning awards, getting traded, or winning a Super Bowl. Typically, only HOF-level or GOAT-caliber players maintain high value over time. Rarity also plays a big role—fewer copies generally mean a better chance of appreciation. Collect to collect though. Spend as if you will never get anything back, and likely you will keep the card forever to pass on to your grandchildren, telling tales of the Josh Allen's 15-2 2025-2026 run and Super Bowl MVP display.

For more advice, communities like r/footballcards and r/sportscards are both great subreddits with a lot of experienced collectors.",21790.0,

I called my buddy, and begged him to grab the jersey from my closet and bring it downtown. By fate, or by luck, the bouncer was a friend of a friend and let me go upstairs the back door for $20. I asked the bartender for a sharpie, and bought josh and his friends a round of vodka redbulls. 
The security let me deliver the drinks, I used that as an opportunity to shake his hand tell him how much of a fan I am. He signed my jersey and thanked me for the drinks. Really great dude! No guts, no glory!! Awesomeness!!! Go Bills!!",14527.0,

I’ve been searching on eBay but everything is extremely expensive. I understand it’s an expensive card, but I’m starting a goal to collect one card from every year he’s been in the NFL. 
I’ve been a lifelong bills fan (23 years).

Some base cards are fairly reasonable. I picked up a select concourse (i think) for about $35. Find some bids and add cards you like to your watchlist, sometimes the sellers will send you offers. 

Hopefully you can snag one! Go Bills!",14527.0,
