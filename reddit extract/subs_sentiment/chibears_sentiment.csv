My pizza version starts out with a layer of shredded mozzarella and provolone cheeses and is topped with shaved pastrami. After quick bake the pizza is finished with diced tomato, crispy french fries and slaw.

This just works so well as a pizza.  There's an amazing mix of textures and temps with the salty pastrami, crispy fries, and the vinegary slaw helps cut through all the richness.  

Hopefully the Bears dream season rolls on with a win today whether the bogeyman plays or not but no matter if they win or lose atleast the pizza was good 🤷‍♂️

On 4th and 20, Davis Mills throws a Hail Mary, which goes through the hands of a defensive player, to score a game-tying touchdown. Then, instead of tying the game, they go for two to go up one point. This secures the number 1 pick for the Bears. 

The Panthers give up an incredible amount of picks, including a 2024 1st round pick, and DJ more.

The Panthers have a terrible season giving the Bears the number 1 pick in a year when several talented QBs are entering the draft.

A lot of the talk coming into the Steelers game this weekend is whether or not Aaron Rodgers will play and if he can maintain his ""ownership"" status of the Bears. I think he probably really wants to play in spite of his wrist injury so he can get one last shot to beat us at home, but to be honest I don't think the Bears are that afraid of him.

Looking at the current roster and coaching staff, I'm only seeing TWO players that have ever even faced Rodgers as a Packer while on the Bears -- Cole Kmet and Jaylon Johnson. The roster has been completely rebuilt in the past three years since he has left Green Bay and I don't feel like he will carry the same weight that he used to. We as fans might certainly feel it, but I don't really think the players will. It's like someone coming back to their old high school after they graduated and talking about how cool they were.

I'm not saying this game is a lock by any means (not trying to jinx us) -- this is definitely the best team we've faced to date other than the Lions in week 2. We'll definitely need the defense to step up and have the offense execute against a tough pass rush.

But the point is I don't see the players viewing Rodgers any different than Flacco, Stafford,  or any other older, less mobile but accurate pocket passer. If we can find some way to wake up the pass rush and get Booker/Sweat/Dexter into the backfield, I think this should be a very winnable game. These don't feel like the same old Bears anymore.

1p076o1,1763456647.0,245,0.93,93,,"An Epiphany about Ben Johnson’s Offense and Caleb’s “Struggles” Hearing Ben talk in his presser about how he “doesn’t do 50/50 balls” made a lightbulb go off.

So many times we’re frustrated about Caleb overthrowing, or not giving his guy a chance in 1 on 1 matchups, etc. Sure, some of this is bad quarterbacking, BUT a lot of it is also by design. hear me out…

Ben Johnson’s offense essentially boils down to this:

1. Hunt for explosive plays

2. Don’t turn the ball over 

Ben’s philosophy is that he WILL eventually scheme open explosive plays. Caleb’s job is to find them. If it isn’t there on that play, Caleb can try to make something happen because he is an elite playmaker, but under no circumstances should he turn the ball over. If he follows these principles, the explosives will make up for the dead plays (and so far that seems to be the case!)

This explains so many of the head scratchers on game day and why when we watch the all 22 afterwards, it seems to show Caleb making mostly good decisions. 

Caleb puts the ball where he knows nobody but his guy can get to it. As a result, sometimes it ends up going to nobody. Hard to watch but it keeps the ball and the possession safe. There is a reason we have the best turnover differential in the league! 

This gives me immense excitement about the future of this offense. As Caleb (and the rest of the offense) starts getting more comfortable, he will be finding more explosives and have a better understanding of how close he can fly to the sun without turning the ball over.  It’s why this offense is so hard to learn and why we need to be patient. Caleb WILL get better.

This time next year, the offense is going to be HUMMING. Until then, enjoy the ride. Right now it’s good. It’s only gonna get better. Then it’ll be the best. 

Midnight ramblings are over I need to go to sleep. Bear down :)

And there's only one way to describe this pizza...

Comforting ☺️

The savory meatballs, gravy, potatoes, and jam are like a cozy sweater of flavor and it felt like a trip to IKEA without the cheap furniture.

Hopefully the Bears can get revenge today against JJ and the Vikings for the week one loss, but no matter if they win or lose, atleast the pizza was good 🤷‍♂️

We have a divisional game, against a team we should have beat earlier, and a defense/coordinator he has a plethora of experience scheming against. The campbell/lions way is go hard all 60 minutes, and i think Ben is going to be ready for this game BECAUSE of the challenge he knows its going to be. 

I think we blow the vikings out of the water this weekend. Maybe I’m optimistic, but they are not a great team and i know he wants week 1 back. 4 quarters of belt to ass in their stadium and setting the tone to go make a push for the playoffs.

Trying to get folks to tag him in and the Bears in the comments and maybe it happens one day! But anyway, I'm just so hyped this happened.

Neither team looked particularly dominant even though this was a “defensive battle.” The Eagles offense has looked off all year and the Packers whom we once thought could be Super Bowl-bound look to be falling apart at the seams. They’ll have a get-right game against the Giants because it seems like Jaxson Dart will miss time, but we also saw these guys lose to the Browns in terrible fashion so anything is possible. 

Love was missing his top weapons, but even still he was missing throws and making poor decisions pretty much all game (not helped by drops nor playcalling), and had a terrible fumble. The Packers O-line also looked like complete shit and while we don’t have the front 4 that the Eagles do, I think dialing up pressure against them will pay dividends for us when we play Green Bay.

As for the Eagles, I still think this will be our toughest matchup for the rest of the season. We saw against the Giants that the Bears suck at defending running QBs, although Hurts this year has been running less than average - Caleb actually has more rushing yards - and Hurts has also been taking a lot more sacks. They held Josh Jacobs to 3.5 YPC, although he still had over 100 yards from scrimmage and a touchdown, and while we don’t have Josh Jacobs, we do currently have the second best rushing offense in the league and that Eagles D is middle of the pack overall but worse against the run.

My main point is, like Coach Ben said, if any of these games are close in the 4th quarter, we got a chance. If we can’t sweep the North, it would be nice to sweep the East and the Packers.",3429.0,neutral

My pizza version starts out with a layer of shredded mozzarella and gets topped with my own chopped cheese mix which is made by griddling onions and ground beef that gets seasoned with sazon adobo seasoning and topped with American cheese and it all gets chopped together. That gets added to the pizza and the mixture gets topped with even more cheese. After a quick bake, the pizza is finished with the traditional ketchup, mayo, tomato, and shredded iceberg lettuce.  

Sometimes simple is special and to me that's what makes a chopped cheese great. The beef and melty cheese is so satisfying and the condiments help cut through all the richness. This combo seriously works so well as a pizza.

(https://old.reddit.com/r/CHIBears/comments/1p090z1/weekly_selfpromo_and_ticketsmerch_sale_thread/) This is another gateway game. If they win, the Black Friday game in Philly (which we all wrote off prior to this season) will be a battle for the #1 seed in the NFC. Not even the biggest meatball homer takes had that game penciled in as meaningful, or even a contest. It's going to be another ugly slog against the Steelers with our injuries, but I'm taking Ben Johnson and this offense over the stale vanilla defense that Tomlin runs. This is the new Bears. Loveland is going to have himself a game and Caleb is going to flex his nuts. BTFD and FTP",48521419.0,positive

But no Lbs, backup CBS our defense is going to struggle. 

Offensively we need to be perfect, control time of possession, run run run play action pass.  We need to run the ball like 35 times. And Caleb and the receivers need to convert those long passes.

We absolutely also need to convert our drives to touchdowns.  The Fgs won't work in this game.",35941792.0,negative

##[Weekly Self-Promo/Tickets Thread Here](https://old.reddit.com/r/CHIBears/comments/1ou6kus/weekly_selfpromo_and_ticketsmerch_sale_thread/) So fun having legitimately important divisional games back. As much as week 1 sucked (I saw it firsthand) the Vikings are clearly vulnerable, and Caleb excels against the blitz which you’d expect Flores to dial up. All in all, I fully trust Ben with now over two months of coaching under his belt to make the necessary adjustments to win. CW: 29/40, 297 yds, 3 TDs, 48 rush yds.

But there's also a very plausible path for this season to get \*real\* interesting.

""Huge takeoff in the second half of their second year"" is a surprisingly common path for great QBs to take, and Williams the last few games is off to a good start on trying to match that.

Every week we get more team experience in the offensive scheme, and some talented rookies in Loveland and Burden are starting to see their playing time increase.

The time off seems to have temporarily humbled CJGJ and I think we can get a half-season of good use out of him. Booker coming back from injury has been a surprising little pick-me-up, he's been better at DE than either Odeyingbo or Turner were.

And we might be getting our best player back in Johnson, plus Gordon too.  This defense is \*very\* different with Jaylon Johnson out there neutralizing top WRs.

The schedule doesn't look as scary as it did when it came out.  JJ McCarthy has proven immune to KOC's QB whispering so far.  The Packers offense is beat to hell with injuries, so is the 49ers defense. The Steelers are ok but not terrifying, the standard is the standard.

The only ""oh fuck, I have no idea how we win those"" games left on the schedule are the Lions (who might have nothing to play for when we play them) and the Eagles.

It wouldn't surprise me at all if we end up being this years' version of the 2024 Commanders.  11 or 12 wins and some noise in the playoffs.",8465796.0,neutral

**[Bear down, Bears nation!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dccJ3MCgU0)** The range of outcomes here is something like the Saints game through the Ravens game.

The Bears are rightfully favored, but all it takes is a little sputtering on key offensive plays, a failure to create any turnovers on defense, and boom you've blown a winnable game. Welcome to the NFL, nothing is easy.

I'm not \*that\* worried about their pass rush.  Benedet is an issue, but a mobile QB like Williams can handle pressure if it's only coming from one spot as long as the rest of the line holds up.  And the beating we should be able to give them on the ground will neutralize a lot of it.

Jaxson Dart is not a bad young QB at all. He's athletic and can scramble well.  He took a lot of sacks againt Philly and Denver, but we are not Philly and Denver defensively.  He's better than Huntley, who torched us with efficiency, but not as good as Flacco and doesn't have the receiving weapons that Flacco did last week.

I'm hoping Booker can be a bit more dynamic for the defense than Odeyingbo and Turner were. Odeyingbo wasn't doing anything in the pass rush and Turner wasn't doing anything period.  Booker isn't great by any means but he can get you a few pass rush wins per game.

We're all panicking about the defense right now, but it's interesting that last week was the first time since Detroit in week 2 it got truly torched in the passing game.  If Brittain Brown doesn't inexplicably go down to try to stay in bounds instead of taking the first down he had open to him with under 3 minutes to go, we chew most of that clock and the defense ""only"" gives up an acceptable 21 points in that game.  Football is crazy.

I'm mostly just excited to see our run game go to work, and that's funny to me because I've never been a run game guy. I've always felt like running the ball is a boring necessity to chew clock in a modern offense after your QB and passing game have given you the lead.   But dang if the Ben Johnson run game sicko isn't contagious.   As everyone has noted, this is the only run defense in the league that can rival the Bengals in terms of terribleness, and against them we had a 28-year-old Brittan Brown getting his first NFL carries and busting a 22-yard touchdown.

If we lose this game, then that's a win we have to make up later against much tougher teams.

If we win this game, it's resonable to start talking about playoff scenarios. Not that it'll be easy to get there, but the path will be pretty clear.",63455817.0,positive
