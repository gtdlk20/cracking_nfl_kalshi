This is probably the best Cowboys team I've ever watched (I started watching the NFL in 2018), and it's genuinely baffling we didn't make the NFCCG. We had a really good chance against the Eagles to win and make it to the Super Bowl that year if we made it to the NFCCG.

2023: The Cowboys went 4-5 against teams above 500. (3-4 against top 10 teams), had a point differential of -26, and scored an average of 25.8 points while the defense allowed 28.7 points.

I do remember the team being a little questionable in 2023, but overall, we were actually beating good teams during those 3 12-5 seasons. Ironically, the narrative that we only beat up on bad teams was at its strongest in 2022, the year we did the best against winning teams.",5787.0,positive

I LOVED the decision. I have no idea what they did, but I trust the head coach to make the call. Idc if they skipped walk throughs or brought strippers back to the hotel rooms, WE NEED ACCOUNTABILITY ON THIS TEAM and it was a breath of fresh air having the head coach bringing it.  

People saying, “do this on your own time not during the game”… no

These recovers are making more a year than most will make in a lifetime, I cannot think of a better way to get it through their heads that they have a team counting on them… once again, I loved the call.

""Everyone grieves the loss of a loved one in different ways.

For Solomon Thomas and some of his Cowboys teammates, giving back to the community together was one of their ways to grieve the loss of their teammate, Marshawn Kneeland.

On Monday, Osa Odighizuwa, Donovan Ezeiruaku, Perrion Winfrey, James Houston, Payton Turner, Jay Toia, Earnest Brown, Dayo Odeleye and Isaiah Land joined Thomas and his foundation, The Defensive Line, at Metrocrest Services, a non-profit social services organization that specializes in helping individuals, families and seniors navigate through crisis situations and work to stabilize their lives for a brighter future, to pack food packages for the homeless and those in need. It came on the heels of an emotional first day back together, but that didn't matter to Thomas and his teammates.

""I think the bye week, being away from each other has been hard,"" Thomas said. ""So I think coming into the building together meant a lot and then also having this and the guys, I even told them, 'Hey, I understand if you don't want to come,' and all of them wanted to come.""

""So the fact that they all wanted to come and just be around each other, I think that's all we wanted. We just wanted to be around each other because we're all hurting, we feel the absence and so we just want to be there to love on each other.""

He has put his life out there for the world to see, he has been as open about metal health and suicide as he could be given his life. He has done nothing but be a positive influence in the mental health community and his story and his financial contributions have saved lives.

For him to have a teammate that then doesn’t use the resources available has to speak volumes to the mental health crisis the men in this world are in.

I’ve been in some dark places and I’ve only been able to pull myself out of them because I had people who cared REACH OUT. It’s hard and it’s awkward but men don’t ask for help. It has to be brought to them. 

I love everything Dak does, he shouldn’t have to go out of his way to ask everyone if they are ok though. He’s doing damn near enough and more than anyone of us has done to influence that space. If there’s one thing we can all do both as fans and as people to make the world a better place, it’s just to take that extra step of caring about someone instead of just being indifferent to them.

Homer had always dreamed of owning the Dallas Cowboys, but under Hank’s unique legal circumstances, that was the best he could do. Marge thought it was “pretty good.” Homer? Not so much.

We traded Micah right before the season, so there was no way we are going to replace him. it's one of the reasons I was pissed about the trade because it waste Cd and Dak primes but can't cry over spilled milk.

> And multiple sources across the league told Yahoo Sports this week they believe Jones will be listening for a plus-sized talent — on the level of the Cincinnati Bengals’ Trey Hendrickson or Tennessee Titans’ Jeffery Simmons — ***if Dallas is in the playoff hunt at the end of October.***

> One NFC personnel source noted that the impending free agency of Cowboys wideout George Pickens could end up being a motivating factor, too.

> “That [Pickens acquisition in May] has really worked, but they need to push it now,” the source said. “I think the Pickens’ [negotiation] starts at the Tee Higgins extension, too. … I’m sure there’s an impulse to [maximize] Pickens while they have him for this run and then tackle the contract bridge at the [NFL scouting] combine [in February].”

> The NFC personnel source noted that the Pickens price point factors at the deadline in two ways. On one hand, if the Cowboys commit to paying Pickens a Higgins-level deal ($115 million over four years), it could push Dallas to sit pat the deadline with the sensibility that it needs to use the draft capital to gain talent on cheap rookie contracts to balance out the salary cap issues a Pickens extension will create. Conversely, if Jones feels like Pickens is pricing himself out of an extension with Dallas, it creates space to acquire a veteran in a trade now to maximize the remaining games with Pickens while opening up space to retain that veteran beyond 2025, since Pickens will be let go in free agency.

> That conversation will also be shaped by the compensation. As it stands, league sources who spoke with Yahoo Sports put the trade value range of Hendrickson at a second-round pick ceiling, or a more reasonable basement of a third-rounder and another later pick in the fifth or sixth round. As for Simmons, it remains to be seen if he’s available, as the Titans have signaled privately that he’s still written into their long-term plans with an equitable deal (for now) that runs through the 2027 season.",11662.0,neutral

They are allowing the most yards per game in the NFL (411.6) and the second-most points (30.7 PPG). And unless DeMarvion Overshown is the second coming of Derrick Brooks, there isn’t much to be hopeful about going into the final 11 games of the season.

However, there is one rookie who is starting to put it together and that’s none other than Donovan Ezeiruaku. And while he has yet to record a sack, it’s not hard to see the improvements in his game on a weekly basis. And what we saw from him in Week 6 was very encouraging.

Cowboys DE Donovan Ezeiruaku continues to show big signs of improvement

In a recent article by Pro Football Focus, they named their top rookie defenders from Week 6. And for the first time all season, that included a defensive player for the Cowboys. Here is what they had to say about Ezeiruaku’s performance against the Panthers:

**""Despite the upset loss against the Panthers, Donovan Ezeiruaku put on a career performance in just his sixth NFL game. Ezieruaku was dominant as a pass rusher. Despite not recording any sacks, he won 20% of his pass-rushing snaps, which included two quarterback hits for a 75.1 PFF pass-rushing grade.""**

Ezieruaku has recorded eight pressures over the last two games, and he’s come very close to recording a sack. But what’s most encouraging is that he’s improved as a run defender. He played 20 run downs on Sunday and performed at an average level, which can’t be said about the rest of the defensive ends on the roster.

The sacks will come, especially after recording six QB hits in the last two games. But the fact that he already looks like the best pass rusher (outside of James Houston) on the roster. And if the Cowboys are going to fix this defense anytime soon, they are going to need him to continue to develop and take big steps forward.

Dallas is relying on Ezieruaku to be part of the pass-rush solution for the years to come. Fortunately, we have already seen enough flashes to be encouraged about his long-term potential. So far, so good for the talented rookie from Boston College.",3325.0,positive

We have all been here before.

You may have heard that Prescott just passed Romo in games played (128-127) or that their win-loss records are staggeringly similar — 78-49 for Tony, 78-49-1 for Dak. Romo has the edge in passing yards and touchdowns but he threw more interceptions, so their passer ratings after the 127 game mark — 98.3 for Dak, 97.1 for Tony — were again almost identical.

And you already know about their playoff runs.

Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about the defense whatsoever. People often cite the cap issue, but it really isn't that big of an issue. The way Dak and Pickens are connecting rn is very special. Add CeeDee to this and this offense can take it to the next level. 

A player like Pickens doesn't go into free agency often, and that's for a good reason. Teams always look to keep their best players whenever possible. 

Nonetheless, if the Cowboys are capable of extending Pickens and a good running back(like Javonte), then our offense will be set for the next few years. Ceedee, Pickens, Turpin, Flournoy will make for a great WR room. And the team has done a good job in rebuilding the offensive line. 

Now, the team will only need to rebuild the defense(which is no easy task, obviously). The Cowboys will probably not sign noteworthy players from free agency, especially on the defensive side of the ball. Instead, they will mostly ignore it like usual. 

The only way the defense will improve is through the draft, just like a few seasons ago. If the Cowboys can draft good defensive starters with their newly gained draft picks, then they will have cheap, young, talent which will allow them to compete for a Superbowl. 

So resigning Pickens would make sense, especially when you consider Jerry's interest in extending him.  What do y'all think? ",32759.0,positive

Holy Cow. We were 9 deep today. Backups at LT, LG, C, RG with the only starter being our ‘weak link’ of the starters of the offensive line. 

Brian Schottenheimer hired Klayton Adams as OC specifically to scheme the run game. Then hired Conor Riley from Kansas State to be the O-line coach.

This has turned out to be a masterclass of offensive coaching. We started three UDFAs, one 7th round draft pick, and one 6th round draft pick on the o-line today and they were flat out moving.

Let's not go around fellating Dak just yet.  He was excellent in the second half against the Giants and excellent in the 2nd half against the Packers.  While he hasn't played poorly at any point this year, he leads an offense that did nothing against Philly or Chicago.  Against Philly, all the offense had to do was score 1 TD in the second half, and it couldn't. Good offenses that play with bad defenses need to take advantage of the few spots where the D plays well.  It played well againt the Eagles in the 2nd half, and the Dak-led offense failed when it mattered,  which remains a common theme.

Dak is the highest paid player in the history of football, despite being somewhere between the 6th and 16th best player at his position.  The team is not failing Dak. His contract creates an expectation that he play at an elite level practically all the time.  He doesn't.  He must raise the level of those around him, and he doesn't do that enough against good teams.

Funny thing about Drew Brees.  He got a ring when he was on a modest contract.  Thereafter. He maximized his money every time, which he had every right to do...and he never got back to a Superbowl.",8345.0,negative

Firing him doesn’t fix anything unfortunately. You either fire him and promote an assistant who is going to run basically the same system, or you bring in somebody new and our talent poor defense has to relearn an entirely new scheme and we are back to where we were at the beginning of the year where guys don’t know basic assignments. We don’t have the personnel to play zone, to play man, or to blitz. You can only scheme so much. Also Jerry will never pay somebody to not coach for the Dallas Cowboys. 

we’re probably going to ride with Eberflus until the end of the season. We’re most likely going to end the season with the worst defense in the NFL.",4241.0,negative
