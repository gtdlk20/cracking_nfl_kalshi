KP gives excuses every time. This is the kindof leader the team needs and we’re lucky to have him.

I would say yes in the fact that it really gets in to the head of the QB. Not only does he need to find an open receiver, not only does he need to feel the pocket collapsing and he also needs to calculate his throwing lanes. Or otherwise put arch on a pass he really wants to throw on a rope. No QB can manage all three. Not Patrick Mahomes, not Jared Goth. 

Davis and Carter ability to block passes of 6' 4"" Goth is really special. I think it's fair to say Goth is not used to worrying about throwing lanes in general. Maybe avoiding a single superstar IL.

1oy2wq9,1763240749.0,167,0.92,203,Question,"Nick's offensive philosophy of ""winning the turnover battle"" and how it affects potential OC changes beyond this year. If Nick's philosophy of ""winning the turnover battle"" is what perpuates this theme of playing conservatively and playing ""not to lose"", is that going to deter away the best OC candidates if we look to part ways with Patullo?

We always say things along the lines of ""any OC would kill to come here and have this type of talent to work with"" but if the OC is just trapped under the umbrella of Nick's philosophy to play conservative football, why would a top tier OC candidate want to come here and be limited to the conservative play designs and play calling?

Even Kellen Moore's ""mesh"" system last season, he was historically known as being a pass heavy play caller, but when he was here last year the passing game was still underwhelming because we leaned on a more successful run-game.

And if we go back to back this season, this will only reinforce Nick's philosophy to live by this formula. I'd imagine whomever the OC is next year, whether it's still Patullo or someone else, they will still be a victim of having one-hand tied behind their back and won't have as much autonomy and leeway of the offense as we'd like.

If I were a top OC candidate looking to move up, I'd want to go to a organization where I'd have the most control over the offense without having the shadow of being limited to what I can design and call.

The other side to this, is that I think the philosophy of playing conservative works right now only because we have an elite defense to keep us close enough in games, if we didn't have Fangio and the talent that we do on defense, I'm not so sure we could afford to be this lackluster offensively.

I just don't see this really changing for the better unless Lurie and Howie basically strip Nick of all control over the offense and let the next OC make all decisions regarding the play design and play calling. Even after the '23 season, I thought this was the thought process when we hired Moore, but it still seemed like Nick still very much had an influence on the direction of the offense last season than we expected. 

As long is Nick is the HC, he will always be credited for the SB win and his overall W/L record. There are certainly power dynamics in play that make any hiring decisions a little more nuanced than not letting Nick have a say in who he can/can't hire as the OC.",31343.0,neutral

A little late update, but I finished my second chemo treatment yesterday. Everything went smoothly and I was in and out in about 6 hours. Now I’m back home getting ready for Eagles vs. Lions! Who we got taking the win? Personally, with the Lions’ banged up secondary, and the fun media week we have had, I think AJ gets 10+ targets and our defense handles Amon-Ra and Gibbs.

Recently, I’ve been in contact with people who know people in the organization (I even did an interview for NJ.com!) and I’m feeling pretty good about my story getting out there. I never would’ve had this opportunity if not for this subreddit, so from the bottom of my heart, thank you all so much. The support and DMs I’ve gotten from people here truly mean a lot.

It doesn’t seem like we have a consistent solution to this problem, similarly to ‘23 when we didn’t have a solution to picking up the blitz.

Unfortunately with AJ being the 1A of the passing offense, he’s always going to be first option that defenses hone in on and take away, which is why so many more opportunities have gone to Devonta and Goedert this season.

For all the people that are annoyed with AJ and want him to be traded this offseason, you have to understand that if Smitty takes over as 1A next year, defenses are going to do the same to him until we find better ways to answer against zone coverages.

1. He's a DJ who mixes his own workout music.
2. He was an all-A student (with one B) in middle and high school.
3. He almost retired from football after a concussion; he really didn't enjoy playing under former Eagles coach Chip Kelly (and to be fair, who has ever really enjoyed playing under Chip).
4. He comes from a family of musicians and can play piano and guitar.
5. He loves epic fantasy novels.
6. He's a cat guy.
7. He works on his mental health after suffering depression and anxiety at UCLA (CHIP!!!).
8. He did an internship at a real estate development company and a fellowship with a company that helps pro athletes transition after football.
9. He's known his girlfriend since fourth grade. After drifting apart, they reconnected during his second year with the Dolphins. He's even written a song about her.

I’m a 25-year-old Eagles fan currently fighting stage 4 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. I started chemo (R-CHOP) recently, and it’s been a tough road. Some days are brutal, but I keep telling myself to just take it one snap at a time.

The thing that’s helped me the most has been watching the Birds every week. Seeing the heart, resilience, and brotherhood of this team gives me the same energy to keep fighting my battle. When I see Jalen lead, AJ and Smitty ball out, and the defense scrap on every play.. it fires me up to keep going.

I recently reached out to the Eagles and a few players hoping to maybe attend a game or meet the team, even just for a few minutes. I don’t expect anything, but I figured it couldn’t hurt to try.

Mostly, I just wanted to share how much this team means to me. The Eagles have become my motivation to get out of bed and keep pushing, no matter how rough chemo gets.

Thanks for letting me share my story, and if anyone has advice or connections to help make this happen, I’d be beyond grateful.

Fly Eagles Fly. 💚🦅

1ohz6u1,1761622147.0,129,0.96,66,Opinion,"Recent criticism of Tush Push does not make sense to me when using it as fuel to ban the play. I fully understand that the officiating on Tush Push plays has been highly inconsistent this season. However, the people who want it banned seemed to have lost the original plot.

People saying ""it's a hard play to officiate"" doesn't make sense because the issues that the refs are having this season have nothing to do with the actual ""pushing of the tush"". 

If the NFL does ban the Tush Push, how is that fixing the officiating issues that have occured with the play (or similar plays)? The officials have had issues with the false start, and the reaching out the ball, but again that has nothing to do with the actual issue that people originally had with the play: the Tush Push. How do refs officiate normal QB sneaks? Why do they have no issues with a QB sneak but struggle with the Tush Push?

They can ban pushing a player but they can't ban a normal QB sneak play which is (imo) very similar to officiate. (Looking for False Starts, correctly calling the play dead, etc.)


TL;DR: Banning the Tush Push due to officiating is not going fix the officiating that occurs on similar plays like a normal QB sneak. (Which is a play that people have seemed to have forgotten about lol)",8297.0,neutral

More and more I think the issue is AJ Brown is super frustrated with the playcalling and wants Jalen to be more vocal with the coaches and give more pushback.

TL/DR: Get AJ in the slot more often and design more shallow crossing routes. Dallas used more zone in the 2nd half of the season opener and our offense hit a brick wall. There’s enough tape on how to beat it and other teams have been able to abuse it. The cowboys beefing up their defensive interior makes it easier for their corners to cover unless Jalen gets rid of the ball quickly. This should be a great game for Smith and Goedert naturally, but KP should really consider motioning AJ and moving him into the slot for mismatches. Hurts can utilize the quick game to catch the cowboys off guard and help the OL. Outside zone runs between Saquon and Tank will keep drives alive as the Cowboys edge isn’t that great aside from Ezeiruaku. Smith and Dotson are great outside WR’s, AJ in the slot would benefit everyone against what looks to be an underperforming secondary. The problem is that I’m just a random eagles fan who can see this and there’s no indication that this will be implemented despite obvious answers. If the eagles lose this game despite them being very prepared on paper, that would be embarrassing",303653.0,negative

I learned from him, it’s much more easy to be negative. The odds are in your favor to pick a loser. Only 1/32 will be the winner. Dude made a career being the mayor of negadelphia. It sells, and at this point, I blame the fanbase.

It just feels like some people in this city are actively trying to make sure we don't repeat. I've listened to 94.1 religiously for quite some time just for some entertainment and keep the time busy. But everywhere in general right now it's kinda crazy. Team is 8-2. Four games above in the division. I could care less if we beat the cowboys 2-0 or 51-7. A win is a win. Time and time again the eagles prove they are able to beat any team in this league. Whether it may be offensively/defensively/or special teams. The only real thing to talk about negatively with this successful team is how to get the main wr the ball. Well unfortunately while they are winning games I could care less how it gets done.",164837.0,negative

1p2a8ac,1763670078.0,9322,0.97,78,Analysis,"Barnwell: Is Nick Sirianni the most scrutinized successful coach in NFL history?  People tend to hate on things they don't understand. Everyone knows what makes Andy Reid a good coach or Sean McVay or Bill Belichick etc. But people struggle to know what makes Nick great.

He's the CEO coach model that has been going mostly extinct over the years. Best equivalents are probably John Harbaugh and Mike Tomlin. These are the ""culture creators"" who didn't get hired because they were some sort of offensive wunderkind, but rather because they can build and cultivate a culture that players and coaches buy in to.

One key difference in Nick is that his personality is much different from the other two guys. He's not Mr. Cool like Mike Tomlin or the boring straight man like Harbaugh. He's brash, animated and some would likely say ""obnoxious"".

So now you have a guy that 1) you don't understand what he brings and 2) he does things that you find annoying. So of course he's not a good head coach. It's all Howie.

But here's the thing. The guy wins football games. He wins football games at a clip that hasn't been seen in decades. He didn't have the growing pain period that Andy had or the cursed first stint like a Belichick. He basically succeeded from day one.

What Nick has done is strike the perfect balance of player's coach and company man. A guy who is not too proud to admit he's wrong and pivot. A guy who takes the blame constantly to take pressure/heat off the people he leads. A guy who doesn't let ego get in the way of winning football games and a guy who has been successful at the highest levels of the game.

But he doesn't look like what we've been told a good coach is. A good coach needs to be revolutionizing the game. He needs to have an offense putting up gaudy numbers. Half our fans would probably trade him for Kyle Shanahan who couldn't win a big game if his life depended on it because at least they understand what he's good at.

I'm old enough to remember when this city HATED Howie Roseman because he couldn't draft. Now he's a legend. The city is a fickle beast. Especially the people reporting in it. But we're very lucky to have this trio of men leading the team.",714345.0,positive

1p2a8ac,1763726854.0,158,0.97,78,Analysis,"Barnwell: Is Nick Sirianni the most scrutinized successful coach in NFL history?  I feel like Nick’s “overachievement index” is generally considered to be low/zero (unfairly), and the perception of him always having this ridiculous talent around is the main reason for his success. “Like a braindead monkey could coach that Eagles team to the same record or better.”

Meanwhile you’ve got someone like McVay who “with nothing but a bunch of ragtag dreamers and a washed Stafford [oh and like 5 HoFers on defense] bootstrapped his way to a Super Bowl. The guy’s a genius!” Forgetting of course that he and his ragtag dreamers have only barely sniffed the playoffs in all those years since. 

I wouldn’t use the word scrutinized to describe the unfair perception of Nick, more like most dismissed. And those propping up the narrative might have to wait another 5-10 years for “the other shoe to drop” on Nick’s success, as long as Howie keeps cooking. And perhaps even then Nick will still only be considered an oddity or statistical anomaly. “Here’s a coach who didn’t know what the fuck he was doing, and still doesn’t, but managed to sustain success for the Eagles all this time [top 3 all time coaching win percentage, multiple Super Bowl wins, etc hypotheticals]. He’s lucky Howie’s there to amass all that talent for him.”",12108.0,neutral

Ball is ball. Ignore the “insiders” and “journalists.” Watch the game. Turn it off when it’s done. Go to work. Live simpler  Hot take: the current discourse is a calculated move by the Eagles organization to increase the doubt on Hurts. Time and time again Jalen Hurts has received heavy criticism, learned from it, and became a better football player. The team ran into a problem after he won Super Bowl MVP, so fearing that the doubters would be silenced, manufactured their own narrative to create another obstacle for Hurts to overcome with the hope of making him better. We already saw an example this season with his increased use and success with play action, and if you remember this was a topic of debate earlier this season.

tldr, Hurts back-to-back Super Bowl MVP incoming, no arguments will be accepted thanks.",7508.0,neutral

Dude worked his butt off this offseason to get in shape and both carry a bigger workload, and be more effective when he is on the field. It is showing in spades. He is everything you could ask for in a space eating DT. 

I know space is gonna get real tight (at least as tight as it can under Howies magic cap ride) in the next few years with Quinyon, DeJean, JC, Dean, Smith, Blankenship, etc being due in the near future, but dude has earned the second contract, and probably quite a bit of additional money from it, to boot.",695907.0,negative

Y'all [media] bring it to me.""  Come on everybody- the team is 8-2 and leading the seeding race having played the toughest schedule I can remember in ages. Whilst our defense has been amazing the last 2 weeks, it's worth considering whether the relative struggles of both qbs was due to the circumstances of the game. I don't think it is a coincidence that Jalen has had 2 weak performances in back to back weeks where the opposing qb had also struggled (arguably much .ore in both cases) - both the weather and field in green Bay made passing difficult, as did the wind/weather against detroit. Both teams suffered multiple dropped balls and the wind made kicking difficult.

This isn't to completely absolve the relatively weak offensive performance so far this season, but to over-analyse the last couple of weeks and somehow come to the conclusion that Hurts is the issue, manufacture some bullshit controversy about frustrations with Hurts within the builsing is crazy and self-harming.

We've had weeks of the Aj Brown circus, and then the moment that seemingly ends/pauses, miraculously another topic of drama appears.

In the 2 weeks prior to the Green Bay game, the passing offense had been starting to look better (admittedly though, against the Vikings and Giants) - I don't think we can use the last 2 weeks as a reliable or meaningful evaluation of where the passing game is for the reasons given above.

The other thing to note is that even with the weak passing performance, we won the game in both cases - in large part due to amazing back to back performances by the defense - but the fact we were winning during what were clearly going to be 2 low scoring games, naturally meant the offense was going to favour being conservative, which Jalen executed effectively - he did just enough and didn't throw any ints/didn't actively lose the game.

Over the past 2 seasons, the team have seen that if they keep mistakes to a minimum and don't do anything to lose the game, then they invariably win. I'd rather we won than the qb/receivers pad a load of stats in losses. We went through a similar journey last year with people questioning the passing game, only for us to turn it on in the playoffs when it really mattered. I think at this point, the team has earned a bit of faith - Jalen's recent record when it comes to wins is outrageous (he's won 23 of the previous 25 games in which he has played, discounting the WAS game in which he was taken out early with the concussion).

Could we please try to not self-sabotage the team (or at least the vibe around the team/players) by knee-jerk reacting and feeding into every supposed narrative and drama that comes along? To repeat, we're the reigning SB champs, on course for the 1 seed despite a horrendous schedule and our team/coach and qb have won 22 from last 24 and 21 from last 23 games, respectively. Where's the crisis? This is almost fantastically successful!

Whilst the natural counterargument is 23/24, the circumstances are very different (see: the defense) and having had that experience, the team should/will be more likely to avoid it repeating. Even so, we still won like 11 games that year  - for many teams, that would be considered a very successful year!",885266.0,neutral

Some of his situational playcalling leaves a lot to be desired for sure... but that call sheet is built each week from the same overall offensive scheme.

That said, I do think it'll get better the rest of the way. Things were looking up after Minnesota (good defense) and NYG (great pass rush).

A pass batted like this is close in terms of the mental state of a qb, but objectively is not same due to no loss of yardage. A TFL is better for a defense as a whole, but has less impact on a qb.

1. This is a TERRIBLE play design for a cover 4. Either KP didn’t expect it or he expected it and had a bad play design drawn up to beat it. There has to be a whip or a quick slant SOMEWHERE in there. Pull the LBs in tight and get Barkley in a wheel route. FUCKING SOMETHING

2. The defense is designed to take away the deep shots: the safeties misplayed the coverage (both jumping the post).

3. I guarantee you AJ saw it was cover 4, blew off the line for the clear out and expected Jalen to go short. Should he take plays off? Not necessarily, but if he were to take a play off, I’d expect it to happen in a play designed to take a deep shot against cover 4. I can promise you he didn’t expect single coverage on this play.

Lastly…the only reason Jalen threw this ball was because the safeties jumped the post. If this was properly played, and it’s not, it would have gone short/run/scramble drill.

Edit: holy typos, Batman

Edit: he 100% wasn’t expecting that ball. He ran head down, got 15 yards down field, never looked for the ball and slowed up. It was a clear out route against cover 4.",9637542.0,negative

""It's kind of unfair to say he's the main problem... it's kind of crazy. Kind of crazy that somebody in the organization would [say] that.""  More than one thing can be true at once. In this case, it's multiple truths that add up to where things are.

+ Hurts is noticeably more gunshy since all the picks in 2023.
+ Nick has always stressed turnovers which feeds into Jalen's ultra conservative approach.
+ The OL isn't healthy. At all. Hasn't been since camp.
+ AJ is either bothered by that hamstring or has lost a half-step.
+ It takes a village during the week to create the 120 or so plays that go in the gameplan, but KP's situational playcalling doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.
+ The entire scheme and philosophy is predicated on our guys winning their matchups, not a cohesive, adaptable system that provides answers and options against any defensive look.

The last one is the one most in need of an overhaul. The rest comes down to everyone coming together and figuring it out. We've got some great matchups the rest of the way to help build confidence as things get sorted out.

My ""sprain"" ended up being a partial Lisfranc ligament tear and significant displacement/dislocation that required 2 surgeries. My foot still isn't right. 

Now obviously I am not a pro athlete with access to a medical staff like the Eagles, but I am definitely concerned that this is worse than the report indicates. Lisfrancs are tricky to diagnose and get right, especially if there is displacement as that is not as obvious. I am really hoping I'm wrong here.

This is NOT an injury to take lightly. IMO they should put him on IR with the hopes he'd get right for the playoffs, but there is still no guarantee on that given the nature of this kind of injury.",448690.0,neutral

Replacing Lane effectively through the draft is going to be a tough task, especially while we're competitive. Let's not forget, he was a #4 overall pick, and the 3 other tackles picked up high with him at the top of that draft ended up being various forms of busts. So a top end 1st for a 25% chance at a tackle that reaches anywhere near Lane's level in that scenario.

I'm not saying it's impossible, but there are other ways to get tackles, and not just the rare Mailata path. Remember we stole Jason Peters for a 1st and that served us well for a decade, and was the reason blocking Lane from shifting to LT for so long that the Eagles ultimately just left him at RT. I think Howie is going to need to be more creative here, or luck out.

I remember one play where they threw a bubble screen to AJ on 3rd down in the game thread and people were losing their minds shitting on the play-call.  Somehow, they missed the fact that if Fred Johnson wasn't late on his block, AJ had an easy 20+ yard gain.

Jalen was off on his deep ball, I’m not sure if that was Jalen having a bad day or him trying to put more on the ball to counter the wind led to the overthrows.

Us not being able to get a TE2 who is actually a positive blocker at the deadline might really come to bite us in the ass. Without our blocking WR and without our FB we just lack depth of good blockers on the outside, especially when Lane goes down. At this point i think we should just rest Lane and Cam as long as possible because they both clearly rushed back to playing and it was not the correct call. I get our schedule is brutal, but at some point we need prioritize having those guys healthy for January and February not November—made this same argument about us rushing Landon back to start the season. 

Kevin did a much better job trying to engineer good and easy looks for AJ as a YAC target this game and we had explosive run designs called back all night for bone headed holds away from the play by the line. Kevin’s had some truly brutal games, but last night was on the players not executing, it wasn’t on Kevin",31251427.0,positive

If we execute like we did in most of the year... we win that game 20/24 to 9 and we complain about only KP. 

Last night had a lot of drops, a lot of procedure errors, a lot of mental errors that typically doesn't happen.

Whilst Q gets a decent amount of respect from fans/influencers/pundits (especially our fans), I still think it isn't enough for how good he is and how well he plays almost every week, probably because he doesn't get many ints.

If he got like 2 or 3 more picks a year, he'd be much  
more highly regard (as in, disproportionately more). However, part of the reason he doesn't get picks (apart from our safeties snaffling them/running into him) is because his coverage is so good that his receivers don't get many targets.

Jalean phillips is great
Dean if continue with his performance could win comeback player of the year.

Oline is fragile (call a spade a spade)

People don’t like the idea of a 2nd round QB originally drafted to be a backup/Wentz’s insurance policy being better than their 1st round pedigree QB.

Then give this 2nd round QB a signature play that specifically works to his strengths as a player? People hate that.

To the overall football world, Hurts was never supposed to be a superstar. Josh Allen was. When Josh Allen does superstar things, that’s just Josh Allen doing what he should do. Hurts doing superstar things? Well that’s because they false start? It’s because Saquon is incredible. It’s because he has a phenomenal WR duo.

I pulled up next to him but the windows were tinted, couldn’t see anything. I was trying to get my gf to look in to no avail. So I pulled back, I sped up to see if it was him, so I just went back to my regular speed behind him. Then this whole entourage of nice cars came flying by in the left when I got to the right lane. Was getting off an exit soon so I was running out of time.  Got back in the left lane behind him and I took a chance and waved to his side mirror. Couldn’t see who was driving still but it had to be him. Then he flashed his back lights
 and I freaked. I said to my gf, that’s him! Then I blew my horn and waved like a nut. He flashed his back lights again. What a moment for me. I got off at my exit as he sped off, or maybe he had a driver, but no doubt, with those expensive cars going by and his license, it was definitely him in the car.  Had to be. So cool to flash his lights. Wish I would’ve saw him, but understandably he had his windows tinted.

Edit: I made a post like this with a pic of the SUV and license plate, mostly got yelled at in the comment section for harassing him. I did leave him be after he flashed and got off at my next exit, I didn’t chase him down the road or do anything to slow him down so I was disappointed that my post got me put in timeout.",26836.0,positive

Obviously don’t need it much last year but we’re on the path for a career low in Hurts play action pass attempts. Maybe we need more of this? The issue with this popular thought is teams are effectively dominating the eagles in the run game. Play action is MOST effective when the run game is effective. Our opponents have handled our run with ease and the O-Line is, alarmingly, getting regularly pushed backwards at the line. Therefore, play action is not as dangerous since they can still keep their shell in a pass defense while the players in the box handle the run. With teams effectively shutting down AJ with safety help on top of a minuscule route tree courtesy of the coaching staff, the only real play action threats we have posed are the post patterns and shallow crossers.

1oy2wq9,1763241179.0,38911,0.92,203,Question,"Nick's offensive philosophy of ""winning the turnover battle"" and how it affects potential OC changes beyond this year. If Nick's philosophy of ""winning the turnover battle"" is what perpuates this theme of playing conservatively and playing ""not to lose"", is that going to deter away the best OC candidates if we look to part ways with Patullo?

We always say things along the lines of ""any OC would kill to come here and have this type of talent to work with"" but if the OC is just trapped under the umbrella of Nick's philosophy to play conservative football, why would a top tier OC candidate want to come here and be limited to the conservative play designs and play calling?

Even Kellen Moore's ""mesh"" system last season, he was historically known as being a pass heavy play caller, but when he was here last year the passing game was still underwhelming because we leaned on a more successful run-game.

This is exactly what I would expect to hear from a guy who has made the Superbowl twice in three years and is too of the standings in the NFC this year. 

It's a problem. I fully understand the philosophy, it works GREAT with a dominant run game. There is, however, no excuse to refuse to do things that are both safe and effective. For example pre snap motion (have been very low percentage every year), play action, RPOs and so on. These are things that add to success and don't correlate with turnovers. 

There's no excuse to run SUCH a pathetic offensive scheme. I feel like KP is not only bad but laos thinks he's doing what Sirianni wants. I don't know that either of them seem capable of understanding that the scheme is reliant on Howie's roster and dumb while they're winning. 

This is fundamentally confirmed by them not changing ANYTHING in the bye week. You score 10 points with this offensive talent and you SHOULD be concerned as most all fans are. Our coaches meanwhile seem delighted. 

This is never changing. We will need Howie and or ownership to step in and force a good OC with experience on Nick. That's not happening this year and it's potentially preventing them from being the best team in the NFC, or at the very least a very good team with a real shot at the Superbowl again. This will end up being a disappointing year wasting an elite roster unless the eagles get super super lucky. 

The bill for the young cheap defense is coming, sacrifices will need to be made on the offense. If Sirianni keeps KP and this attitude it's going to get messy.",344768.0,neutral

If Nick's philosophy of ""winning the turnover battle"" is what perpuates this theme of playing conservatively and playing ""not to lose"", is that going to deter away the best OC candidates if we look to part ways with Patullo?

We always say things along the lines of ""any OC would kill to come here and have this type of talent to work with"" but if the OC is just trapped under the umbrella of Nick's philosophy to play conservative football, why would a top tier OC candidate want to come here and be limited to the conservative play designs and play calling?

Even Kellen Moore's ""mesh"" system last season, he was historically known as being a pass heavy play caller, but when he was here last year the passing game was still underwhelming because we leaned on a more successful run-game.

And if we go back to back this season, this will only reinforce Nick's philosophy to live by this formula. I'd imagine whomever the OC is next year, whether it's still Patullo or someone else, they will still be a victim of having one-hand tied behind their back and won't have as much autonomy and leeway of the offense as we'd like.

If I were a top OC candidate looking to move up, I'd want to go to a organization where I'd have the most control over the offense without having the shadow of being limited to what I can design and call.

The other side to this, is that I think the philosophy of playing conservative works right now only because we have an elite defense to keep us close enough in games, if we didn't have Fangio and the talent that we do on defense, I'm not so sure we could afford to be this lackluster offensively.

I just don't see this really changing for the better unless Lurie and Howie basically strip Nick of all control over the offense and let the next OC make all decisions regarding the play design and play calling. Even after the '23 season, I thought this was the thought process when we hired Moore, but it still seemed like Nick still very much had an influence on the direction of the offense last season than we expected. 

As long is Nick is the HC, he will always be credited for the SB win and his overall W/L record.

Whether that be promising up and coming OC’s from other teams, veteran HC’s fired who were solid OC’s, or even a former OC.

The one I have my mind set on has to be former Saints OC Pete Carmichael Jr. currently an offensive assistant in Denver. He was the Saints OC from 09-23 and is only 54 but has somehow never been a HC. 

He had a top 10 offense with Brees and only struggled when he didn’t have a consistent QB after Brees retired in 2020 (Winston, Seimian, Book, Dalton, Hill, and Carr)

I can't recall any true lockdown corner in the 2000s as good as he is with his footwork, hips and mirroring skills.  Maybe? We've had some really good players amongst the churning sea of stopgap corners. He's a young lockdown corner who has never let me down. He's rarely out of position and forces perfect throws and circus catches to gain any ground on him. If he stays an Eagle and doesn't have an insane fall off, he would be one of the best to ever do it in this uniform. The picks will come, or maybe they won't. Those things might matter for the Hall of Fame, but I've seen plenty of guys who got a lot of picks really fast that weren't exactly elite corners.

 It's a risky thing to jump a route, and truly elite players will be able to calculate that risk with high precision. But it's a risk, and this current iteration of the Eagles is highly risk averse. Which makes Q the best Corner for us right now. If he isn't getting picks himself, he's forcing riskier throws over the middle where Baun, Cooper, or Blankenship are cleaning them up. Having a steadying presence like Q on the field allows other players to play their game better. If they dont have the trust they do in him, they play worse. 

I'm incredibly glad that he is an Eagle and I am excited to see where his career goes. We truly do live in the Good Times right now, at least when it comes to being fans of the Philadelphia Eagles. So much young talent, budding superstars, most of them with good, mature heads on their shoulders (I love the Breadman but he can be a knucklehead sometimes). Good owner, great front office.

You could put that on Patullo too I guess, because he doesn’t seem to add anything at all, unlike the wrinkles that Moore added last year. The “easy button” stuff I don’t know. The lack of play action is frustrating, especially when we run 10+ times out of a formation and never pass. Then when we do run it, seems like it’s almost always the same design to Goedert. RPO I don’t know. Maybe they’re trying to protect Jalen from injury? I think I’ve accepted the offense is going to be pretty boring in general, but it works when you have someone competent as OC. We can control the clock and move the ball without being especially exciting, minus a few big plays.

1owmky8,1763123504.0,282,0.94,111,Analysis,"Rate of Motion and ""Easy Buttons"" for playcallers  This has been a nick offensive thing for years and I tend to think he’s right based on our usual top 10 finishes offensively in his era.  It can look bad, but over a large sample size, his teams are top 3 in rushing and just good enough in passing to be efficient. 

We have a playmaking QB1 that is not a rhythm and timing passer.  For all those Shannanhan, Mcvay offenses to work, you need the ball coming out on time, every time.  That is not Jalen’s strength and nick leans into scheme/concepts that allow Jalen to scramble, use zone reads, or generally put 2nd level defenders in conflict.  

Then people go, why can we not just have more under center play action.  I think it’s a question of what does that  take away and the whole footwork issues of that type of offense.  

For the most part, the offenses on the right top have guys that give you nothing as scramblers.  So there’s a lot of Gaga that gains yards, but puts the ball more in harms way and leads to more turnovers.  

Jalen was leading the league in scrambles this year and has consistently been very good in this area.  Anyway, the idea that the eagles need more or less of those style of offenses is a bit silly.  We’ve seen this thing humming on multiple occasions over this year.  We’ve seen the bottom as well.  1st half of the cowboys game.  2nd half of the rams game.  1st half of the bucs.  

They need to be better and more consistent, but after 4.5 years of nick/jalen, I tend to think the idea that running a different style of offense or comparing to more play action heavy offenses with non playmaking QB1s is not the answer.",29689.0,neutral

We are at a league-wide 15-year WORST in terms of three-and-out.  I don't know how people can look at charts like this and not realize that this year's issues are MAJORITY on the coaching.  There is no “it’s both sides” to this argument.

* Jalen Hurts missing a throw here or there does not lead to this kind of historically poor performance.
* Our team as a whole, not executing as well as last year's high, does not lead to this kind of historically poor performance.
* Our offensive line, despite its injuries, is still blocking at league average.  Their decline does not lead to this kind of historically poor performance.
* Our schedule, while tough, does not lead to this kind of historically poor performance.

We have one of the best offenses in the entire league.  Every single position position is at \*least\* Top 10.  [This era of Eagles has NEVER operated like this before](https://www.reddit.com/r/eagles/comments/1ouh69k/eagles_3_and_out_rate_versus_key_offensive/).  And yet, here we are, this season, performing in a historically poor way.

It's the system they're forced to operate in.  It's the play design, the play calling, the predictability, the lack of adjustments.  In short, it's the coaching - that is the difference maker.

It's basically meaningless because it doesn't account for down, distance and field position. For example getting 20 yards on a 3 and 25 would lead to a higher passer rating that getting 15 yards and 3 and 14. That is why epa is the onlt statistic people should use.

The offense comes to play and they score 30+ to assert their dominance aided by a shut down defense to kick Detroit out of town and firmly claim first place in the nfc. 


Based on what we’ve seen from the birds O this year, I fully expect the defense to come out, hold the lions at bay for maybe a quarter, but the offense can’t get rolling and the defense exhausts itself leading to an ass whooping.

Let’s be clear and this is what I hate about the lazy reporting in Philly sports.

This is a Patullo and a Sirrani problem. 

Last year it got called out by the players.

This year it got called out. Lane was furious earlier this year about. They met about it during the bye again bc the players voiced their opinions so loudly. 

When we’ve had success it’s bc they brought attention to it. Remember Smitty calling his shot earlier. The coaching is failing them. How Siarrani can’t explain how your number one is not being targeting for large parts of the game is inexcusable.


Yes nick it is a a debate you arrogant dick. You trying to tough guy a reporter was weak as hell. Be a man an answer or don’t to insinuate it was a bad question that your locker room and legit everyone watching is asking is a bitch move.

AJ literally said point blank a few weeks ago that KP and the plays AREN'T the issue.  Anybody that's looked at any All 22 footage from any of the games where AJ is barely targeted can see that he's open quite a bit. Execution matters. He doesn't need to be schemed open. He's already there. 

AJ doesn't have an issue with Jalen, KP, or the actual offensive system. He's just frustrated that he's not getting the ball when he's open, then has it forced to him when he's not.

Keep that shit in house otherwise like Hurts said it can become a distraction when they have to keep addressing it and/or having their words twisted.

For example the last 4th down attempt, from what it seems was a rogue call where the QB was clearly trying to appease AJ…and then he gives a dogshit effort which should’ve been the easier pass interference he ever drew, but because he was discouraged and mopey it affects his play….in football there is no worse feeling than to be discouraged….it impacts the way you play the game.

I don't know how people can look at charts like this and not realize that this year's issues are MAJORITY on the coaching.  There is no “it’s both sides” to this argument.

* Jalen Hurts missing a throw here or there does not lead to this kind of historically poor performance.
* Our team as a whole, not executing as well as last year's high, does not lead to this kind of historically poor performance.
* Our offensive line, despite its injuries, is still blocking at league average.  Their decline does not lead to this kind of historically poor performance.

We rush on 1st down, lose yards, get behind the sticks, go 3 and out with a cowards draw

Jalen is having as efficient a year as ever, Smitty having a breakout year and the offense in general is 7th in PPG..

Brown actually averages more targets per game than Smith A lot of the misses to Brown I think came against the Bucs where they were trying to force it to him. 

Jalen has to be better at getting him the ball when hes open but the bulk of the blame goes to Patullo. There were reports that Jalen and AJ were beefing last year too but they were still able to get AJ the ball. 

It really doesnt make any sense to me. I dont think AJ wants out or that he hates Jalen as much as the media narrative. I just dont think he is happy with the offensive scheme and gameplan week to week. 

This is just my opinion though. None of us really know haha",5610755.0,negative

Brown actually averages more targets per game than Smith Maybe I am out of base here, but most of the games i've watched AJ hasn't really gotten separation on his routes like in previous years. A lot of the time I can't blame Jalen for not chucking to him. Yes, the scheme and the OC completely suck, and do nothing to help anyone's case, but to some degree, it seems like there's either a decline in ability, lingering injury, or maybe just bad luck (or all of the above)?

Brown actually averages more targets per game than Smith The problem with looking at raw numbers is we're not taking into consideration how many of AJ's targets are deep shots, targets where Jalen is trying to make something happen after the pocket breaks down leading to a very tough catch, or in big situations where the entire planet knows that AJ Brown is the first read and will almost certainly be getting the target.  

I don't think his frustration is with the number of targets either.  He's open quite a bit and the ball just isn't going to him.  Everyone that's talking about him needing to be schemed open should go watch All 22 footage from the other night.

The refs don't really suck this much, they're just doing what they're told so that eventually the play will be gone. I will say that in a regular play, there is a lot more space between the offensive and defensive lines. The tush push has both lines literally nose to nose and it’s so crowded in there you can’t always tell if someone jumped. So it makes ‘some’ sense. But the eagles guards jumping early seems new to me. If they have been doing that for the last four years there would be a lot more video proof. So it’s in the eagles best interest to not jump early because it just adds fuel to the fire, even if the refs refuse to call it.",36223.0,positive

I thought James Jones was spot-on last night on Shady & Acho's podcast: Jalen is knocking AJ off the HOF path, all the while playing himself onto the HOF path given the rate they're winning. They don't let WR's into the HOF by the same criteria as QB's.

AJ is absolutely justified to feel this way as a top 5 WR -- especially when he USED to be utilized to the fullest. I don't wanna hear anything about the need to run the ball. In the 2022 season, AJ had almost 1,500 yards, DaVonta had 1,100, and the Eagles were STILL a top 5 rushing offense. There is no excuse for this bullshit nowadays.

It's almost like you have to coerce Jalen to look his way more than 2-4 times a game. Forget KP for a minute -- How many times do I have to watch AJ run TOTALLY FREE right across Jalen's face & he STILL won't throw him the ball!

Joe G from WIP (asswipe) claims the offense might be just fine without AJ in the future  because maybe Jalen won't feel ""pressured"" to have to think about getting him the ball. WTF??? Only in Philly, I swear. Anywhere else, QB's are dying to get their top weapon the ball as much as possible. It makes life easier on the QB when he has top weapons like that. Only here is getting the ball to your best & easiest target considered to be ""pressure"". Unreal. Think Montana felt ""pressure"" to get Rice the ball? Or Aikman to Irvin? Or the guys who threw to Moss, Fitzgerald, or Megatron? Think Burrow is under pressure to get the ball to Chase? Yet, we gotta bribe Jalen to look for AJ consistently anymore.

1. The Eagles are currently the best in NFL history inside the red zone.  If KP gets the blame, he’s gotta get the credit.

2. The OL has been injured and middling on running plays.  That’s hurt the entire offense, and isn’t KP’s fault.

3.  They’ve intentionally tried to protect Hurts health by avoiding the zone read/read option plays that were crazy effective the past few years, but caused Hurts to take a lot of hits.  Barkley feasted on the zone reads because the D had to pause to see if Hurts would give or keep.  That’s a Siri decision, not a KP decision, and I suspect they will loosen it up for the playoffs.

As much as I love Dean, I don't think Howie is going to pay two LBs, especially with Campbell as a first round pick.

Carter will reset the DL market.

It's impossible to fumble or take a safety in that situation. It was a very heads-up play to try to make something happen. Here is how it is worded in the rulebook:

>Article 2. First Touching Beyond The Line

>“First touching” is when a player of the kicking team touches a scrimmage kick in the field of play that is beyond the line of scrimmage before it has been touched by a player of the receiving team beyond the line. If the ball is first touched by a player of the kicking team, it remains in play. First touching is a violation, and the receivers shall have the option of taking possession of the ball at the spot of first touching, provided no live-ball penalty is accepted on the play, or at the spot where the ball is dead. First touching does not offset a foul by the receivers; if there is a live-ball foul by the receivers that is enforced, either before or after the first touching violation, the violation is disregarded, and the penalty is enforced as customary.

Whether it’s a backbreaking penalty by the o line or a terrible run up the middle to Saquon that goes nowhere or loses yards, they’re in 2nd or 3rd or long wayyyyyyy to often which completely kills so many of their drives and limits the offenses upside tremendously. And as it has all year the run plays are completely uninspired and predictable by defenses in stacked boxes and the o line misses tons of assignments and hasn’t been getting the push it did in the past",24698.0,positive

You can punt and try to pin them deep but there is no game winning upside

So you have 2 options that risk giving them the ball at that exact spot, a FG and Going for it

A FG if successful makes it a 6 point game and gives them the ball back

A conversion wins the game out right

So it's more upside, with the same risk",2746503.0,positive

I don’t want to jump on patullo hate, but with this elite roster, Lurie has to bite the bullet and pay an OC over market value in order to stop him from getting poached. Not sure what it is about Sirriani’s system but clearly it is not plug and play with coordinators at all",46926343.0,positive

Ok.  Rant over.  GO BIRDS!!!! 🦅 My hot take is that the Packers are so bothered by Big Brother syndrome that they always seem to irrationally hate any rising NFC team that has fewer Super Bowls than them. Us, they’ve hated on the Rams and Bucs, they really hate the Seahawks for having their number, but they don’t express the same seething hatred for like, the Niners Cowboys or Giants like they do for us. This is just my experience with the Pack fans I’ve personally known but I swear sometimes they hate losing to us even more than the Bears.",43904.0,neutral

The Eagles didn’t technically clinch the NFC East during the bye week, but that tired stat about how no team has won consecutive division titles since the 2003 and 2004 Eagles? We can say good-bye to that. Yeah, all three other division teams lost. And that’s big. And yeah, the Eagles have a three-game lead in the NFC East with half a season to play. But what was really striking about Week 9 was seeing just how much of a mess the Cowboys, Commanders and Giants really are. The Cowboys have lost three of their last four, their quarterback is 32, they have the 2nd-worst defense in the NFL and they’ve won four playoff games since 1996. The Commanders have already lost more games than last year, they have no clue how to keep their gifted young quarterback healthy, they have the oldest roster in football and their quarterback is now a 32-year-old who’s won eight games since 2019. The Giants somehow beat the Eagles a few weeks ago, but that’s their only win since Week 4, their gifted young quarterback is taking a beating every time he goes out on the field, they have the 29th-ranked defense in football, their coach keeps coming unhinged after every bad call and they’ve won one playoff game in the last 14 years. A glance around the NFC East truly hammers home just how much stronger and more stable the Eagles’ franchise is than any other team in the division. They have the best owner, G.M., coach, quarterback and roster in the NFC East, and it's not close. The Cowboys, Commanders and Giants aren’t just losing, they’re giving their fans no hope that they even have a clue how to turn things around. And the Eagles just keep rolling. If the Cowboys go 4-4 the rest of the year – and I can’t imagine that happening – the Eagles would need to go just 2-7 to clinch the division. If the Eagles go 6-3 the rest of the year, they clinch the division even if the other teams suddenly start winning every game. Having a magic number of six with half the season left is crazy. The Eagles aren’t just better than every other in the NFC East, they’re the only team that has a vision for the future. Sorry, NFC East. They’re not going away.",384975.0,neutral

 Wentz was special before the injury. He was also fearless then. I don’t think he was ever the same player since. Add on the fact that he never wanted to move off hero ball and believed his own hype a bit too much and he just wasn’t going to last as soon as he got figured out. You have to adapt to stay in this league. You can’t just play the way you want and it bit him. 

Wentz today is a lot more humble. He’s smarter. He’s more poised and methodical. But now his body can’t hold up anymore. It’s sad. He’s a lesson in hubris.  But at least he made his generational wealth and does continue to see games occasionally.  I’m happy for the guy overall",6353868.0,neutral

 People like to shit on Wentz but the fact is before the injury he was playing great, far better than Dak in the same division and after injury still finished up runner up to the MVP and got second team all pro in 2017, just like Hurts did in 2022.

He was never the same after injuries mentally or physically it seems, but Stafford, Burrow, and Herbert have zero all-pro nods between them all. So at least we got to experience Wentz at his best, however brief it was. 

He was a star that started dimming out far too soon, but damn did he burn bright at his peak.",1752791.0,negative

There’s a stupid amount of reporting on how toxic the locker room was from 2018-2020. Whether it’s the Sproles thing, the Alshon Jeffery thing, or Golden Tate flat out saying the most toxic locker room he’d ever been in was ours when he was here.

Howie knew or at least saw what Hurts could be when he drafted him in the 2nd round. We all forget Hurts was a national champion and his final year at Oklahoma he was a damn Heisman finalist…could argue he should’ve won. That’s not a trick play gadget type player especially when drafted in the 2nd.

The Eagles organization failed Carson and he did himself zero favors in 2020 with the terrible attitude and play. The final straw for me was against Dallas. There was a play he rolls to his left, has all the time in the world to see this defender sprinting straight at him where he could throw it away or scramble and slide….and he gets obliterated for a sack. Right then I went “yeah it’s over for this guy he doesn’t have it anymore” It’s sad for him, but of course us fans are going to move on. We’ve been to 2 Super Bowls in the 5 years since he left.",1095494.0,neutral

 I hope in his heart he realizes how important he was to that year. We don’t get to the spot where Nick is able to go on that legendary run with the god-tier run Carson was on prior to it.

In some ways I like the idea of having a dome so Philly may get a Super Bowl and other world class events and it would probably be really loud!! Hard on the opposing team.  I think the Linc is a great stadium and I enjoyed going there in the mid 2000's when I lived there (moved south in 2004).  The dome would be great for fans to be comfortable.  But on the other side, you lose that great outdoor feeling and the elements that make football great (McCoy running for 200 yards in a foot of snow against Lions in 2013, etc).  I would just hope it would be a nice-looking stadium.

Banner was actually a lot like Roseman when he was the Eagles GM - always looking for ways to maximize the value of contracts and draft picks and properly manage the salary cap.  The primary difference between the two is Banner didn’t have a good human touch when it came to negotiating with players; he came across more hardball than Roseman does.  But speaking as an Eagles fan who was already a young adult when Jeff Lurie bought the Eagles (i.e., I clearly remember all of Lurie’s ownership tenure) and had longtime friend Joe Banner as his right hand man very early on, the line from Banner to Howie Roseman isn’t hard to see; they think and operate in a similar manner in many ways.",10866939.0,neutral

1or9ndv,1762583554.0,4614,0.99,77,Video,"Banner breaking down Howie's strategy  A lot of what happens in NFL front offices, and frankly on the field, makes more sense when you realize that many coaches and GMs are more worried about keeping their jobs than just about anything else.

Risk taking or big/flashy moves of any kind can put a target on your back if they don’t go your way. Because of this, GMs and coaches tend to avoid that stuff if at all possible. They’d rather be conservative, make the safe bets, or do nothing at all.

You could see this on the field with going for it on 4th down. For years the analytics clearly showed going for it on 4th and short on the opponent’s side of the field was the statistically right choice, but most coaches were still kicking until Dougie P had the Super Bowl run where he was going for it on 4th more than anyone, including the best trick play in Super Bowl history. Now suddenly it became “safe” and everything is going for it on 4th and 5 past the 50. If it dint work out? Oh well, Dougie P did it and won a Super Bowl, I was just trying to win like them. 

Howie does not operate under this paradigm. You can argue if it was the chicken (Howie earning trust through decisions working out) or the egg (Lurie trusting him to take risks and sticking with him if they missed) but it doesn’t really matter. Howie is free to think as Banner describes. Of course other GMs are free to do this as well, but they risk their boss not being John Mara should things  go sideways on a decision or two.",356293.0,positive

Honestly this is very true. Regardless of whatever he has posted on social media not once has he insinuated that he does not want to be on the Eagles or that he wants a trade. 


If anything it's some fans (not all or even a majority) that act like they do not want him here. Personally I do not care about his social media posts. My annoyance is with everyone else overreacting and boosting his tweets or comments or trying to play Clue with how he feels based on everything but what he actually says.

3. The Eagles have a TON of primetime games over the second half of the season, plus playoffs.

It hit me really hard, and my thoughts are a bit messy because of it.

It was exactly eleven months ago that I tried to take my own life.

Depression is horrible. Horrible doesn't even feel like a good enough word to describe how depression makes you feel.

Life is really short. Appreciate the time that we have together, and tell the people that you love that you love them. Hug your family and make an effort to go and see people.

If you only see your dad once a year, and he lives another forty years. That's only forty days that you'll see him. Don't let those years go to waste.

You never know what somebody else is going through. Depression makes you feel alone, it makes you believe that nobody cares about you.

So please, reach out to your friends. Being there for them might save their life one day.

And if you are struggling with feelings of depression or suicide, please reach out to somebody. I know that it's hard. I've been there. But please, reach out to somebody. I promise you, life is better with you in it. Things can get better.

Depression is a horrible thing. Life is short. Hug your family. Tell your loved ones that you love them. Don't waste the time that we have together.

I don't know what he was going through, but I know that when I survived my suicide attempt, I felt bleak and hopeless and that nobody understood the fact that I was suffering. Looking back on it, I wish that I could have told my friends and family how I was feeling, but I didn't believe that any of them cared about me.

Since then, I know that this isn't true at all, and I've found an entire community of people who care about me.

You never know what somebody else is going through, but being there for somebody might save their life one day.

And if you are struggling with feelings of depression, or suicide. Please reach out to somebody. I promise you, life is better with you in it. Things can get better.

I agree overall with his statement that if you aren't producing they will find someone else but AJ/Smitty are in a category that it doesn't apply to. That thinking applies to players like Dotson, Metchie, Cooper, Calcaterra, Shipley, Bigsby, etc. 

We have given AJ 2 massive contracts with a massive amount of guaranteed cash in the last 4 years, so I don't really think what he says applies to himself. Howie has proven to him that we want him here no matter how he is producing. 

AJ wants the stats and if winning comes with it cool but its pretty clear that that is what he is now focused on after becoming a champion.

Yes, AJ can run block and be happy that the team is winning, but 1) how can he justify a $96M contract getting 4 catches a game and 2) he’s a highly talented and driven player who loves catching footballs. He even said, the Super Bowl was nice, but murking defenders is what really gets him excited.

WR/TE is inherently challenging where your production is almost completely out of your control. Sure he can (and does) get open a lot, but it has to be tough for anyone with that much talent to give it your all week in and week out, to not be involved, and have that all outside be of your control",89242.0,neutral

1. He's a DJ who mixes his own workout music.
2. He was an all-A student (with one B) in middle and high school.
3. He almost retired from football after a concussion; he really didn't enjoy playing under former Eagles coach Chip Kelly (and to be fair, who has ever really enjoyed playing under Chip).
4. He comes from a family of musicians and can play piano and guitar.
5. He loves epic fantasy novels.
6. He's a cat guy.
7. He works on his mental health after suffering depression and anxiety at UCLA (CHIP!!!).
8. He did an internship at a real estate development company and a fellowship with a company that helps pro athletes transition after football.
9. He's known his girlfriend since fourth grade. After drifting apart, they reconnected during his second year with the Dolphins. He's even written a song about her.
    

I like this guy. Glad he's an Eagle, even if it's only for this year. With that bio he’s definitely reading the subreddit (unless he consciously avoids it for mental health). Hi Jaelan!",18157.0,positive

The Eagles are making a bet that they can get more out of Jaire Alexander than the Ravens did, but his film doesn't lend much optimism.  I’m not gonna comment on every play he showcased but I will on the first 3.  

On the first play, 23 is right where he should be in a prevent. He kept his guy in front of him and made the tackle when he caught the ball.  That’s how prevent works. You’re not trying to stop them from catching the ball, you just try and keep them in bounds and in front of you. This is why I personally hate prevent defense, because all it does is prevent you from winning. 

On the second play, here’s where context matters.  Yes, 23 got beat on the route, Palmer is a decent wr and ran a great route. The reason 23 takes the PI is because at that point in the game up 10 it’s better to take the PI than to let the wr catch and score. Again make them run as many plays as possible.  Also on 4th and 5 that was a terrible coverage call by the d coordinator who if you watch the ravens this year has been epically terrible.  

And then on the third play, this one just feels like someone who knows nothing about football,  being made to look stupid in the open field by cook, is just how it goes for virtually everyone. Other than Barkley, cook is the open field rb in the nfl.  He may even be better than Barkley in truly open field. 

Honestly I probably would have preferred if they used better assets to get a better player so I’m not even really defending Alexander, but at least be fair to the guy and give context for the plays you are pointing out. Maybe also point out that the entire ravens defense has looked bad and out of place all year long. That this is probably the worst ravens defense since the 90s. 

Alexander is coming to the eagles where he has one of the better coaches in the nfl, some of the best players in nfl to play with, and at most he’s gonna be asked to defend the other teams 3rd best pass catcher. Also the eagles, because they have Mitchell and DeJean who are both excellent cover guys and don’t need help as much have the ability to give a guy like Alexander safety help pretty much anytime they want. It’s a completely different role he’s gonna be asked to play. ",25597.0,neutral

My dad went from being the first person in his family to graduate college to just about to retire after two decades as a CEO. The biggest lesson he’s imparted that I know I struggle to execute is that many people, even high performing professionals, often make decisions that they think minimize short-term risk and never realize they’re creating long-term lodestones. 

Howie is an absolute master at avoiding this mistake. He will always pay a small price for something that might make the team 1% better, because he knows the price of a miss can easily be accounted for in the future. 

If all of these acquisitions miss, we will have all offseason to correct an issue that would’ve existed anyway with virtually the exact same resources, plus or minus a few draft spots. 

If just one hits, that’s a hole that’s now plugged for next season, and so on. 

Being risk-averse now means wasting 2-3 months of time you could spend trying to fix the problem. Yet most people would choose the former.

Most tush pushes today DIDN'T pull it off. They were mostly unsuccessful. Which only gives more of an argument for keeping it legal. OTHER TEAMS CAN'T DO IT!!!!


1) It's not harder to officiate because all those complaints are pre-snap, which isn't relevant to pushing the tush

2) It's not an unfair advantage because nobody converts at nearly the rate we do (except Brady at 92+% *without* the push).

Note: If it were such sn unfair advamtage and some loophole that's harder to officiate, easier to get away with false starts, and is tooeasy to convert, thenEVERY TEAM WOULD DO IT EVERY GAME!!!!


I saw as many failed tush pushes today as I did failed 3rd & 1s and 4th & 1s. Also, what I saw even more than rush pushes today were BALL-CARRIER PUSHES! How many times a week do we see a ball-carrier start to grt piled up on and slow down, still churning feet. It turns into a pile. Defense is tush-pushing the tacklers! Then the offense starts tush-pushing the ball-carrier. It's xalled moving the pile. It happens multiple times per gsme EVERY FUCKING GAME!

But it's the black QB in Philly, so it's bannable.

The only way they could bannthis is with some cucky rule like, ""you can't push the person who takes the snap directly when under center within 2 seconds of the snap,"" because you can't ban pushing the pile.

If this were the government, they'd call it a Bill of Attainder, banned by Article 1, Sections 9 & 10. It's a rule that would target a specific entity. Complete Bullshit, and very cucky.

I’m a 25-year-old Eagles fan currently fighting stage 4 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. I started chemo (R-CHOP) recently, and it’s been a tough road. Some days are brutal, but I keep telling myself to just take it one snap at a time.

The thing that’s helped me the most has been watching the Birds every week. Seeing the heart, resilience, and brotherhood of this team gives me the same energy to keep fighting my battle. When I see Jalen lead, AJ and Smitty ball out, and the defense scrap on every play.. it fires me up to keep going.

I recently reached out to the Eagles and a few players hoping to maybe attend a game or meet the team, even just for a few minutes. I don’t expect anything, but I figured it couldn’t hurt to try.

Mostly, I just wanted to share how much this team means to me. The Eagles have become my motivation to get out of bed and keep pushing, no matter how rough chemo gets.

Thanks for letting me share my story, and if anyone has advice or connections to help make this happen, I’d be beyond grateful.

It would be great if every guy in that locker room was wired like Jalen and valued winning above all else. But that’s just not what makes AJ tick. He’s not lazy, he’s not unfocused, he’s not angling for a new contract…he wants to dominate and be as involved as possible and is not happy when he doesn’t get the opportunity to do that 

& BG is right. Finding that middle ground is gonna be what keeps him here for his career. He’s not getting traded this season or next because of the crazy cap hits and where the roster is in terms of Super Bowl window. So if they want the smoke to stop they gotta find some balance between the ugly ass wins of this season and airing it out to AJ 10+ times/game like early 2023

Told this story before, but I became an Eagles fan back in 2005 watching the Super Bowl. I was living in Germany then, so the game didn’t start until around 2am. Had to ask my parents if I could stay up to watch it.

Of course my little brother (he was about 7) wanted to stay up too. He fell asleep way before kickoff but knew the Eagles were playing the Patriots. When the teams ran onto the field, I woke him up — and he looked so disappointed when he saw the Eagles.

Turns out he thought the Philadelphia Eagles were hedgehogs, because the German word for hedgehog is Igel, which sounds kinda like “Eagle.” So he had been imagining the “Philadelphia Hedgehogs” the whole time 😂

He was so confused, but that moment made me an Eagles fan for life. Even though we lost that Super Bowl, I’ve been die-hard ever since — been to Philly twice, saw the Eagles in London, and now my whole family are fans too.",875353922.0,neutral

That’s what the league outlawed: a defender turning themselves into a pendulum swinging around the runner as a fulcrum, and then intentionally slamming into the runner’s legs to trip them up. 

They didn’t outlaw dropping your hips or unweighting. They didn’t even outlaw landing on a runner’s legs, they just outlawed intentionally doing it in a particular and specific fashion that is known to put players at risk.

Play calling is steadily improving, scheming is better, passing and running working in tandem. Defense is better with nakobe in there as well. Dude loves to ball. Seems like they simplified makuba and ringos duties and if so that could be huge if they continue to improve.

Josh beats up on weak/0.500 teams and has a couple of crazy highlight plays every week that reel people in. Half the reason that the Bills can't get past the Chiefs every year is because Josh turns into a deer in the headlights when playing competition with a ""clutch"" gene that won't fold when the Bills go up late (or by two scores at any point).

In terms of playoff narrative for Josh Allen, the Ravens aren't clutch. Texans aren't clutch. The Chiefs? Extremely clutch - and Josh Allen can't put them away.

I'd love to see this analysis stratified for Yards, Completions, TDs etc. against teams with winning records, historical playoff experience, and top-10 ranked defenses. I think you'd see a pretty clean break between Hurts and Allen (in Jalen's favour) when toggling for this.

On an unrelated note, the reason why Jalen holds on to the ball for so long isn't because he's stupid or a slow processer, it's because he simply refuses to allow himself to make a mistake. Sacks >>> INTs every single time.",1082291.0,positive

He holds a shovel, and stands in front of a large, grave-like hole. He gazes into it, a small satisfied smile on his face.

The Tush Push not getting false start penalties because the RG curled a finger a quarter of a second before the ball snapped is obviously the worst one!

The fumble was absolutely ridiculous and I had a friend who doesnt hate the Eagles ask me ""Does that mean the Tush Push is just unfumble-able?""",16595.0,neutral

I fully understand that the officiating on Tush Push plays has been highly inconsistent this season. However, the people who want it banned seemed to have lost the original plot.

People saying ""it's a hard play to officiate"" doesn't make sense because the issues that the refs are having this season have nothing to do with the actual ""pushing of the tush"". 

If the NFL does ban the Tush Push, how is that fixing the officiating issues that have occured with the play (or similar plays)? The officials have had issues with the false start, and the reaching out the ball, but again that has nothing to do with the actual issue that people originally had with the play: the Tush Push. How do refs officiate normal QB sneaks? Why do they have no issues with a QB sneak but struggle with the Tush Push?

They can ban pushing a player but they can't ban a normal QB sneak play which is (imo) very similar to officiate. (Looking for False Starts, correctly calling the play dead, etc.)


TL;DR: Banning the Tush Push due to officiating is not going fix the officiating that occurs on similar plays like a normal QB sneak. (Which is a play that people have seemed to have forgotten about lol) I was at the Ravens-Bears game this past Sunday (had never been to their stadium, went down with a coworker who is a Ravens season ticket holder), and saw a similar fumble issue (Caleb Williams pass to Zaccheaus in the 4th quarter).  He makes a football move right after making the catch, defender stops him, and he fumbled the ball.  Refs made the same kind of bullshit call (his “forward progress” stopped, so the fumble “didn’t count”).

The quality of officiating has nose dived.  Yeah, there were bad calls back in the day that didn’t have social media and such amplify how bad the calls were, but it just seems like in this day and age, some of these calls, for or against, have been absolutely stupefying.",16595.0,neutral

As boring as it is to the pick the QB, for me, this is a guy that wants to be the best but isn’t loud or overhyping himself up. He’s all for the team, his on-field pep talks, and his post-game interviews where he’s all poetic and quotable wisdom but mostly how he deals with the negative noise. This is a guy that is happy to be doubted and loves to prove people wrong and I think there’s something really valuable in that attitude.

Zach Braun and Jalen Carter because I love watching defense be determined. AJ got some bad press recently (and I’ll admit, not helping himself) but I really enjoyed him on the sidelines, on the Eagles’ social media silliness and the way he talks and shares about mental health is something we need within the sports world.

Honestly most exciting has probably been Saquon although it might just be recency bias. Shady was great of course but I swear it feels like every time Saquon gets the ball it can be a 80 yard run.

The first jersey I ever bought in any sport was in the offseason between 2021 and 2022. It was midnight green, and the name on the back was Hurts.

The silent confidence, the leadership, the team mindset, the adaptability, the strong internal locus of control, the wisdom, the dedication to the craft, and the belief in oneself are things I always strived to internalize throughout my life, and seeing a guy my age show all that on such a big stage under high pressure and in the face of largely unfair scrutiny is inspiring.

I mean, my favorite superheroes have always been guys like Captain America (Steve, mainly) and Superman (Clark), so I guess it's not surprising that my favorite athlete would be a guy like the one Hurts presents to us on and off the field.

I’m sure it’s just salty Giants fans and Eagle haters, but perhaps some of you smart people can enlighten me The play sucked, not taking way from what happened at all, but no it was not a hip drop tackle. Dart under threw the ball, Baun was already in the air for a pass breakup and Skattebo slowed down. When they collided and hit the ground Baun had him wrapped up, but landed behind him. If it was a hip drop tackle Skattebo's legs would have be underneath Baun and the initial contact would have been on the ground.

Honestly, I understand what happened sucked but the media needs to stop jumping to put blame on someone. It's football, shit happens, but the whole point of a hip drop tackle is the player latches on from behind and unweights themselves to pull the other player down like an anchor.

Also watching Daboll get upset on the sideline is very funny. They set a new standard for ineptitude today! 1. Not a bad call, but crazy early to call the forward progress stopped. 

2. Not replaying the fourth down when there was a whistle during the play. Just bad officiating. 

3. Really bad false start missed by them. They called offsides but it was clear that we moved first. 

4. Terrible reversal on the strip sack. That was called a fumble and should have stayed a fumble. 

5. Obvious pass interference, not sure what the broadcast booth was on about. He pushed off with full extension early in the route. Hilariously the r/NFL thread cuts this part off and just shows the hand fighting. 


Overall the refs were bad and it favored us. But we would have won anyway, this was not a close game. Just like the refs were horrible and favored the Broncos in that game. Sometimes you're on the bad end, sometimes the good. The refs aren't cheating, they are just incompetent sometimes.",3781107.0,positive

FOX did them no favors by not showing replays of any? of the procedural penalties, except the one they missed.

I know a lot of fans still hold his ignorant comment against him but I believe he's learned from that after he apologized and from his other past experiences to really be a great guide for his players.


Also I think he plays against Coach Vick at the Lincoln  Thursday*.

Like I feel like most other teams, when their players get hurt, it’s usually on one specific play where the player clearly gets hobbled and has to leave the game. But for us we don’t hear about it until the Wednesday practice and it gradually spirals into the player being out the next game.

When any other player is on an injury report for something they’ve previously been on the injury report for, the common response is “oh they must’ve aggravated it somehow.” But of course when it’s AJ Brown, the media goes “AJ Brown REFUSING to practice 3 days straight! Eagles must be trading him despite AJ saying Philly is home, Lurie saying they aren’t, and Howie telling GMs that AJ isn’t leaving. AJ hates Jalen so much that he won’t even practice reps with him!” These people are morons looking to generate clicks and we eat it up because AJ and Jalen’s relationship is private and god forbid they don’t want to share those details with the media.

Sorry for the rant but I’m getting so sick of this. AJ is a top WR, the most physical in the game, and the posts are not as deep as people think.

I for one am impressed that he has become such an impact player in just two years and he hasn't hit his peak yet.    sure he got that pick 6 into his bread basket last sunday... but that doesnt really make an edge player an impact player.  he still needs a lot of development in his actual position.  i think he will get it and he will succeed.  but im not ready to pretend he is an impact player because he had an impactful play.  jalex was supposed to be a project.  knew that from day 1.  i think we forgot about that with how he showed up in the playoffs... but he shouldnt be expected to be an impact player this early.

not to bring everything back to the latest BG excitement, but i really think the ""project"" guys like hunt really really benefit from having some vets around them to help them along.  its great having coaches around that may have done it back in the day and may know how to teach fundamentals, but its something else having a guy who is currently doing it able to mentor you through the learning process.

  
its like coming to a new job and having your great bosses and a great employee handbook... and then having the guy who has been there for a couple years there to tell you what part of the handbook matters, or the things in the handbook that havent been updated, and the little tricks that helped them but no one wrote down.

I for one am impressed that he has become such an impact player in just two years and he hasn't hit his peak yet.  He was so much better than he was ever supposed to be last year, so I think expectations were a little high for him coming into this year. 

He's also pretty much inherited the snaps Josh Sweat had last year, almost by necessity. A huge increase from just over 20% that he had last year or whatever. Howie was clearly hoping for much more from Uche, Ojulari and Z. Smith so that Hunt wouldn't have to play as much. 

Nolan Smith coming back and BG being there, even in a limited capacity, should help him. And ideally Uche finds more of a groove now that he's on the board with a sack. 

I like Jalyx a lot and was delighted for him to get that pick six. Another of those and a few sacks will make this season look a whole lot better for him. I still think he'd be better as the ""3rd guy"" like he was down the stretch in '24, but Josh Sweats don't grow on trees, so he's had to play more whilst other guys haven't been healthy or producing.",29978.0,

- Colts O-Line literally went to shit and he had nobody to throw to and Irsay threw him under the bus for everything.
- Washington had barely any receivers and needed a rebuild
- The Rams if I recall correctly he actually was able to do pretty well with the chance he got because they were well run and had a good roster.
- The Chiefs threw him out in against starters with the Chiefs backups and he just got crushed or was running for his life because the Chiefs had no depth in 2024.
- Vikings O-Line this year is one of the worst I've seen with how many hits they've allowed. Literally allowing 2 QBs to be injured across multiple weeks. Dude has great receivers, but no time to throw

Nah dude I'm not sure how you can watch that game and blame Carson. He's started 4 games for the Vikings and has been sacked 19 times...that's tied for 7th most in the league from a guy that's started 3 less games than a lot of people.

Dude got killed back there and was playing while hurt. The Vikings O-Line is criminally bad.

He got hurt and was still trying out there. He's obviously a shell of himself, but saying he cost the Vikings the game is so off-base.


>You know what though? He’s never cost the team, scratch your head bad.


Nah that pick against the Giants 2 weeks ago was egregious. Or sacks he's taken when he's a statue in the pocket where he all but kills a drive. Hurts still fucks up, just much less frequently/severely than Wentz


He just also plays better on average so his downs are much rarer to see.",9458.0,

But Jalen had 4600 total yards and 38 total touchdowns that year. And won 11 games with the 30th ranked defense by ppg. Not because of “flukey” wins. Because for the first 10 games Jalen was consistently willing this team to victory and leading game winning drives every other week despite terrible defense and play calling. He was in the lead for the mvp race after the bills game. Then SF showed the league exactly how predictable our offense was and it became too much to over come. 

I’m not trying to say that was by any means his best season. But if that’s his worst season that’s a pretty damn high floor.",9458.0,

He was uncharacteristically risky before the bye. It must have scared him too because he went back to protecting the ball and it was almost all downhill from there.

Jalen had a bad day againts the giants and thats like 2 bad throws one of which was a pick. He looked good last drive until the fumble. 

We have a safe, ice cold, clutch motherfucker who can fumble the ball away early in the superbowl and not let it phase him in the slightest for the remainder of the game. Want to say some things about his toughness and such but thats jynx territory to say it out loud. Hes also a smart dude with a great deep ball who even when improvements are slow they are still incrementally there. So yeah lots of pluses for Hurts and the negatives are blown out of proportion.

Firstly, and I wouldn't trade it for the WORLD, but I think winning the Superbowl mostly on the back of a defense that only *really* gave up 6 points before we entered garbage time has created WILDLY unfair expectations for the defense this year. As if the D letting you any points against a team ""less than"" the 2024 Chiefs is somehow a massive failure. We as a fan base really need to adjust our expectations.

Secondly I think a lot of people are expecting way more from Mukuba than is really fair. He's a rookie, he's going to make mistakes. I like him a lot more than I dislike him, but apparently some people around this sub think he's the second coming of the trash cans.",142114.0,
