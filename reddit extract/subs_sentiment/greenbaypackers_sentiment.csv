I am a NJ Packers fan since birth and I was at the game at Metlife last Sunday against the Giants wearing my cheesehead. Sometime in the third quarter I felt a tap on my head and heard “Hey Cheesehead turn around”, 

I turned around and saw a man, not wearing any specific team clothing just a normal black jacket. He said “$500 for your cheese hat right now?”. I said “What? Show me the money.” This man whipped out $500 in cash and handed it right to me. What else could I do…. I took the cheese right off my head and handed it over before even taking a second to think about it. He put it on his head and disappeared out of the section like nothing ever happened, not saying another word.

I have never been more confused in my life, and the people around me just stared and screamed in confusion as well. Yes, I feel like a sellout for that but I ordered a new one for the fantastic price of $27 after tax right when I got home. 

I took it to the bank and the bills were real. Why did this man give me $500 for my piece of foam? I am so confused but as a broke college student during the holidays… all I can say is thank you and god bless you to whoever this guy was. ",24461.0,neutral

1ozssq4,1763414534.0,327,0.9,139,Fandom,"Jordan Love had arguably one of his best games yesterday but the game will be lost to history. Finished rewatching all of his passes and you can only blame love on two of his eleven incompletions. 

First drive of the game pass knocked away trying to lay it off to Jacobs.

Final drive deep for Golden.

Six others were perfect passes that were dropped the only one you could maybe argue is the one to Wicks.

The other three were free runners instantly beating our O-line 

Despite the negative play Jordan did enough to overcome two of the three. The first drive his pass was dropped on the FD conversion,  final drive of the first half he was stepped on as he went to take it himself resulting in a sack and end of the drive, first drive of the second half they’d go on to score. 

Of his six drives (ignoring the drive he was hurt on his only pass was ANOTHER drop erased by  penalty) 

They would score on three of them two would end in perfect passes being dropped. One exception to this is the final drive of the first half which went as followed- 

first down conversion throw to Doubs Walker was instantly beat on protection, a incomplete contested catch Morgan was dog walked back into Loves lap, a bad snap Jordan recovered and tossed to Musgrave who dropped it, finally well covered play Love is about to seize the day light if he does its most likely a first down but he gets stepped on the last possible second and falls resulting in a sack.

A monster game from Love that stats will never reflect and a game nobody will likely rewatch after next week.

This is my take on Gruyère Cheeseburger au Jus from The Fulton by Jean-Georges. It's a fairly simple burger to the eye, but a lot of work in practice. You can think of this burger as an elevated French onion burger. The menu from the restaurant isn't the most descriptive, so I did my best to make my own version of this burger. 

They don't list what kind of bun they used, so I figured I'd lean into the defining flavor of this burger, and opted for toasted onion buns. The cheese is right there in the name, Gruyère Cheeseburger au Jus. The menu lists a ""chili dijon mayo,"" but they don't mention what kind of chilis. For the mayo I used: 

1 egg Yolk

1 tbsp lemon juice

1 tbsp dijon

1 tsp of Calabrian chili

A pinch of salt

A small pinch of pepper

A smaller pinch of MSG

3/4 cup of avocado oil

Just like any other mayo, combine your non-oil ingredients in a food processor, and run until combined, then slowly add in your oil until the emulsion is created. 

This burger also has fried onions smashed into the patties. I had enough leftover that I decided to throw some on top of the patty too. The onions were thinly sliced, and marinated in buttermilk before dredging in flour seasoned with togarashi, paprika, Cayenne, cumin, salt, pepper, and MSG. Then they were just fried until golden. 

The last component of this burger was also the reason it took so long to make. You're given a small cup of jus for dipping. For this I made a pretty basic beef stock in my instant pot. I browned my soup bones on the sautee setting before adding, two onions, a couple ribs of celery, a few small carrots (including a small amount of the carrot greens), shiitake mushrooms, a few garlic cloves, a small handful of peppercorns, a few sprigs of thyme, and enough water to cover. Then I pressure cooked it for two hours. After straining out the solids, I chilled it so that I could more easily skim the fat off the top. 

The next day I simmered the stock with more raw onion until it was approximately a quarter to a third of the previous volume (this took a good chunk of the day). I strained out the solids again, added salt and sugar until I got the seasoning right, then I called an audible. Instead of leaving it a broth, I mounted the heavily reduced stock with a  knob of butter and vigorously stirred to emulsify. Doing this gave it the more velvety texture, kind of like a pan sauce. 

This burger was decadent. That's really all there is to say. It ended up probably a bit too salty, but it was delicious. I learned about this burger through a local chef who is active in the Twin Cities burger community because he added his own version to his restaurant's menu, and I've loved the concept of it ever since. Granted, a lot of that is because I LOVE onion. ",3052.0,positive

That year, the family got Green Bay Packers season tickets and decided to use them to honor Todd’s memory.

“My son had Duchenne muscular dystrophy. He was in a wheelchair. We applied for season tickets, but he passed away before he got them. We knew Todd was going to succumb early in life. And I basically decided, you know, that wasn’t the time to cry about it,” said Craig, Todd’s father and co-founder of Wheel of Todd, a nonprofit that donates handicap tickets for Packers home games to children with disabilities.

That mindset turned into the Bells giving other families the experience of a lifetime at Lambeau Field.

“We didn’t want to just give them the tickets. We wanted them to have everything as free as possible. So, we give them a motel room for two nights. We give them $1,000 to spend anywhere they want. And we drive five hours to come here to put on a tailgate party and roll out the red carpet for them, like my friends did to our son,” said Craig.

Before the Bells got season tickets, Todd said he didn’t want to go to Packers games in the cold.

“He said, ‘Well, Dad, what would you do with the other tickets?’ I go, ‘Well, maybe I could sell them, or maybe I could donate them,'” Craig recalled. “\[Todd said\], ‘Oh my God, Dad, that would be so cool if you donated those tickets.'”

Since then, the Bells have donated tickets for 42 Packers games.

“The smiles that the kids get, and then the parents usually start crying, and it’s like we’re instantly bonded,” said Bell.

Hannah Otto has muscular dystrophy.

“Me and my mom had a very rough year. I had a lot going on along with graduating, and my mom’s been really sick and in and out of the hospitals. So, I basically wrote in how I wanted this to be like a big experience, where I can make a bunch of memories with my mom,” said Otto.

“I was driving home from a doctor’s appointment, and she called me and she was crying so hard I could barely understand her. She’s like, ‘I won tickets to a Packers game, Mom!’ She was so excited,” said Shannon Larrabee, Hannah’s mother.

In exchange for the donated tickets, Craig and Julie ask for one simple thing in return.

“Just a picture of them holding a sign that says, ‘Thank you, Todd.’ That’s all we want,” said Craig.

For those given the experience of a lifetime, they’re more than happy to say thank you to Todd.

1ovbs5r,1762969162.0,150,0.73,204,Analysis,"hear me out: the Packers are totally fine I will definitely admit that the Packers haven't looked great the past two games, at least in a sense. the Eagles game was an abomination offensively, to be sure.

HOWEVER, let's consider a few things.

**1. the offense doesn't suck.** 

it has hit a lull lately, but in the Panthers loss they actually drove the ball at will. They had a bad fumble, missed FG, and a dumb INT ruin three of their drives and then MLF got overly aggressive on 4th and 8 when they should have settled for a FG.

despite a trainwreck, they only lost by 3.

**2. this team has scored 27+ points in every non loss**

Green Bay's offense is not ""awful"". It just isn't perfect. the o-line has been banged up and inconsistent all year. that's led to a less than potent ground game, which bleeds into protection and what they can do down the field in the passing game.

oh, and they have not been healthy in the passing game in terms of weaponry, either. Reed died immediately, Watson only got back 3 games ago, and Golden is a rookie who has now been battling injuries or didn't play the past 2 weeks.

**3. the defense is elite (but not perfect)**

I think it's because we're packers fans, but if you actually watch even the best NFL defenses, they GASP do still give up first downs, big plays, and touchdowns.

Green Bay's defense is not perfect, but it is very, very good. they grade out well against both the pass and the run and that defense has kept them in their 3 losses, giving them a shot when the offense was just not getting it done.

Green Bay had one truly bad game on defense all year and that was on the road against a talented and desperate Cowboys team.

**4. Jordan Love is fine**

Love makes dumb plays, to be sure, but he is very good with a clean pocket, and even in a horrendous performance on MNF, still bounced back to make some clutch throws and put the Packers in position to win or tie

he has been mostly great this year. no QBs have been 100% elite throughout the year. the only ones that comes close are Darnold and Stafford and even they both have had some questionable moments.

**5. firing MLF isn't it**

lastly, I don't think canning MLF or stripping him of playcalling duties is the answer. I think the Packers have a talented roster that is inconsistent and he's trying to do the best he can with what's in front of him. sometimes he looks like a genius and sometimes penalties, turnovers, missed FGs, or dropped passes combine to pressure him into some questionable decision-making.

I hated the 4th down play at the end of the game, so you definitely can roast him for that. but more often than not he has the packers looking solid on offense and literally has had them in position to win every single game this year.

overall, a ton of Green Bay's issues stem from health and execution. they are still one of the best teams in the NFC and they control their destiny. 

now, if they lose to the Giants....

1outh4i,1762915267.0,208,0.82,81,Analysis,"The Packers’ core problem is LaFleur’s identity, not just talent or scheme In my humble non-expert opinion, Green Bay’s main issue right now isn’t “no talent” or “bad scheme.” It’s that Matt LaFleur’s own football identity is internally inconsistent, and that inconsistency leaks into the team.

At his core, LaFleur is a cerebral, QB-centric offensive coach from the Shanahan/McVay tree: motion, condensed formations, play-action, using structure to create explosives, and leveraging a smart QB to run it. The peak Rodgers years under LaFleur are the proof of concept: hybrid scheme, high efficiency, back-to-back MVPs. His best football clearly comes when the offense is built around the quarterback in a structurally aggressive way.

The problem isn’t the absence of a system; it’s what he does with that system when stakes rise. In big moments (championship games, key 4th downs, end-of-game decisions), he often regresses to a conservative default: takes the ball out of the QB’s hands, leans on “play it safe,” or tries to win via “system ball” and defense. At the same time, he frequently pushes toward a run-first, wide-zone vision even when the roster (OL, QB, WR group) is better suited to a more pass-leaning, QB-driven approach. The result is a HC whose identity in theory is QB-centric and aggressive, but whose instinct under pressure is conservative and system-centric.

That wobble shows up on the field. Teams with a clear identity impose their style on weaker opponents and keep playing their game in big spots. The Packers instead often play to the level of the competition, oscillate between aggressive and timid gameplans, and melt down in high-leverage situations. Players feel when a coach preaches “trust the QB, be aggressive” all week and then, on the decisive snaps, acts like he doesn’t trust that premise. It creates a diffuse message: what are we actually trying to be?

This doesn’t mean LaFleur is a bad coach. He’s a good-to-very-good offensive mind with a proven track record of efficient units and QB development. The issue is that he hasn’t resolved the conflict between his QB-centric essence and his conservative reflex under pressure plus his attachment to an abstract idea of “how the offense should look.”

The path forward is conceptually simple (though not easy):

1. Explicitly embrace a QB-centric identity: the system exists to maximize the QB, not to prove that it works without one.

2. Lock in a coherent risk philosophy (4th downs, red zone, 2-minute) and stick to it when it’s uncomfortable, not just against weak opponents.

3. Adjust the system to the roster, rather than forcing the roster into an idealized system (e.g., accept if the OL/QB profile points to a pass-leaning identity).

Until LaFleur fully commits to living and dying with his QB and aligns his risk tolerance with that choice, the Packers will keep reflecting his ambivalence: stretches of very good offense, punctuated by meltdowns that are less “random collapses” and more the predictable output of an unresolved identity at the top.",13986.0,neutral

1 tbsp ketchup

Luke Musgrave wants to prove that he can ball out in Tucker's spot. The Packers O-line wants to prove that they can create a run game. The Packers want to prove that they have made the leap to a contender and not merely a playoff team.

Sure, any given week some of these things are going to be true, but this week, all of them are true. All of them need to be true. And the Packers are at an inflection point.

His biggest issue is he cant adapt his game plan when his script goes awry. You cant win a SB without that out the box thinking.

Hes got all the talent but cant deliver. super bowl quality talent here in GB

If we fire the head coach of the football team that is positive in win loss right now, who will take over? And better yet what offensive schemes will we be adapting to the same or different? 

Learning a whole new offensive scheme literally takes a whole off season and y’all just want to go to the drastic measures of everything, sit down and take a chill pill. Firing a head coach especially mid season literally throws everything in the shitter. We are not miraculously out of nowhere are going to get good if we go this route so calm down.

Am I saying you don’t have the right to criticize him? No he deserves every criticism right now because of his unwillingness to let go on some of the lateral plays and unwillingness to trust his quarterback to sling it. He is also choosing Brandon McManus over Havarsik.

But to fire a head coach and cause even more inconsistency is just much more hurtful than anything. Please take off the doomer glasses and think of it rationally. ",17373.0,neutral

If you have to be better, BE BETTER. We've been coming up short in the same ways for YEARS and it never changes. Stupid playcalls, bad clock/game management, awful special teams play... It's infuriating. 

  
I'm not sure exactly what it is but something needs to change systematically with this team. Defense has studs all over the place and we're still playing like Joe Barry is the DC. BE AGGRESSIVE. We pay Rich Bisaccia a king's ransom to be STC/AHC and it's still awful. Golden has zero TDs through eight games. GET HIM INVOLVED. 

  
I really like the offensive creativity that MLF brings to this team but I'm worried he has too much on his plate or isn't willing to do what needs to be done regarding other coaches on this staff. Part of me believes that he would be better as an OC because for years, he hasn't been able to wrangle this team into a cohesive unit that plays complementary football and doesn't take stupid penalties.

I don't know if Rich makes the McManus call, or MLF, but he's obviously not 100%, and if we can't trust him in a game that was a single score then he shouldn't be suited up.

Still a penalty on nearly every ST play. While not the catalyst, a functioning ST likely sees 2 extra wins this year. 

It's just not good enough. Too many mistakes not being learned from. Too many issues with flags. Too many fumbles, badly fielded kicks, poorly blocked kicking teams and punting teams play, the list goes on.

Literally anyone on the staff should be able to take over for Rich and not do much worse.

It's the little things he blows that result in MLF making some bizarre calls later on in the game. That's on MLF, but it also is on him for keeping R.B around this long with zero improvement on ST.

1ohk6o5,1761584919.0,298,0.97,54,Fandom,"The ""Inconsistency"" of Jordan Love: An Unabashed Hype Post One of the best things about Jordan Love is that he doesn't look back. During his first season as a starter in 2023, I could not have been more impressed with how cool under pressure he was.

Whenever he makes a boneheaded move, which we all know he has, he does not often let that carry over into the next play and the next and the next. He very rarely does anything that resembles a complete meltdown or crumbling (see Dak Prescott in the 2023 season WC playoff game against us, or Caleb Williams in...well, you name it). Sure, we've seen Jordan get discouraged, but at the most it's for the duration of one game. Then he comes out shooting the following week and does some amazing things, even though he may not play like a HoFer. Consequently, and rightfully so, he is called inconsistent. 

But I have to ask this: when we have a new starting QB who is learning, experimenting, figuring out what went wrong and then doing better going forward between snaps, can we really be *that* upset about inconsistency? Sure, he sat behind the GOAT, Aaron Rodgers, for a couple of years. But watching from the sidelines is not the same as playing under those bright lights, leading the storied Green Bay Packers while tens of thousands of people are screaming their expectations and their vitriol and millions more are watching on live television. How spoiled are we by Favre and Rodgers (who, let's not forget, had their own learning curves)? 

Yes, this progression is just what one would expect from your franchise QB, but let's be serious. Look at some of the other young QBs in the league (CJ Stroud, et al.). The ability to take that path with grace and aplomb is not as common as we think. We need to maintain perspective, here.

Does Jordan Love have areas in which he needs improvement? One hundred percent. Sometimes he seems to make some questionable rookie reads, for example, although I wouldn't say he's alone in that. However, the ability that Love has to dust himself off after adversity/bad plays and move on with calculation, take frustration and channel it into improvement, on a play-by-play basis? That's special. That's what you want in your young, up-and-coming franchise QB. That's one of those intangibles that can't really be measured in stats, other than the steady upward trend over time. As we can see, the numbers don't lie, fellow cheeseheads.

We are seeing a marked improvement in his decision-making. He is taking care of the football in a way he didn't before. He is taking his risks still, but they are more calculated, and what's more, *they are paying off.* He is standing up for his guys and telling MLF, ""Hey, let me go for it on this 4th & whatever. I can do it. This offense can do it."" And to his credit, finally, MLF says, ""Okay."" 

*And then Jordan Love and the Green Bay Packers fucking do it.* 

He's confident without arrogance, he's unselfish, he lifts up his teammates, and he's always got his eyes set on how he can do better in the next moment. He knows that the most important play is always the next one. I think his journey to where he is, his unlikely success, has taught him that setbacks will happen, but with his talent and work ethic, he knows he can overcome. Jordan Love has ice in his veins, but, maybe more importantly, he also has fire in his heart. 

He embodies the spirit of the Green Bay Packers that I have come to know and love. So I will, unironically and without any reservations, say that Jordan Love is HIM. Jordan Love is the guy. Jordan Love is *our quarterback,* and we couldn't be more fortunate.  

Fuck it. We ball. 💚💛💚🫶",15898.0,positive

Toothless play calling, undisciplined mistakes all over the field, poor decisions and a team that consistently under performs despite being an absolute juggernaut on paper.

Last night was different. Specifically the 2nd half adjustments and the way they figured out what the Steelers were doing and had Answers.. LaFleur had them looking good last night. It was the first time I can remember when the special teams weren't a liability. They were chucking the ball down the field and they gave 10ve the go ahead to play his game and he gave us an incredible performance. 

We've been waiting for a game like this. It felt like everything clicked in the 2nd half and with Carolina on deck, we've got one more game that we SHOULD win to build on what we saw and make sure we're stepping on necks and playing to the potential of the team going forward. 

Last night was really exciting, not just bc we got to beat Rodgers and the Steelers in their house in prime time, but because our team finally looks like a Ferrari instead of a Civic with a body kit. To me it was bigger than one game and watching them play well in all phases was really encouraging and I think LaFleur deserves all the credit in the world for getting them right.

The biggest difference is with Malik in they play to his strengths which means getting him out on the run. This means moving the pocket which makes things easier on the oline and harder on the dline. With Love they haven't been doing that which has let the flaws with our bad oline and questionable pass pro stick out like a sore thumb.

That's a pretty worrying trend for a guy who is getting paid $25 million per year and has the luxury of playing in a defense where Micah Parsons is taking all of the offense's attention.

The defense of the Packers has been the most reliable part of the team. Why do so many want to crap in my corn flakes and call it autumn? (This isn't a real saying) (Yet) Defense has been good. But opposing teams are clearly realizing that our IDL can be gashed for 3-4 yards a carry and that quick timing throws consistently produce 4-6 yards. We started the season looking absolutely dominant against teams that were super bowl contenders last year. That set expectations sky high.

Now it turns out the Lions have lost a step and the Commanders run may have been a combination of Jayden Daniels going on a tear and also getting very lucky not to injure himself.

But expectations are still sky high. So when we lose to the literal super bowl champions from last year and a Panthers squad that’s resurgent, plus only barely beat a Giants squad that had a fire lit under them by the firing of the HC, we’re a “disappointment” and “underachieving”

What we’ve seen is a reversion to the mean. The Packers are a good Football Team, facing a schedule without any real cupcake games. We will still probably make the Playoffs. If we get lucky we can go on a run and do more than that.",124671.0,negative

The defense of the Packers has been the most reliable part of the team. Why do so many want to crap in my corn flakes and call it autumn? (This isn't a real saying) (Yet) other guys have said it but ill put it in my own words because im also a little frustrated at the situation. The book is out on how to beat the packers, limit the amount of time we have on offense and exhaust the defense. teams wont throw deep and are content to run or dink and dunk to keep us off the field. how do you combat that? negative plays. (run stuffs, sacks, turnovers) which gives the offense the ball and more possessions/time and forces the opposing team into obvious passing situations where they cant rely on getting the ball out quick.

what does this have to do with gary/parsons? if other teams game plans are the quick/short passing game and theyre going to chip, double or triple team parsons, hes going to have a lot of trouble sacking/disrupting/pressuring the QB fast enough. but everyone else is getting 1 on 1 or favorable looks so we need them to win and win quick to disrupt the opposing game plan and generate negative plays.

Gary gets paid somewhere in the top 10-20 of edge rushers. but he plays significantly less snaps than those in his contract bracket. now that may not matter if that meant he stayed super fresh and was extra disruptive but thats not the case. hes at a career low in quick pressure rate and by most other stats (pressures, pass rush win rate) he just is performing poorly. Granted so is just about the rest of the line. but that allows teams to block parsons and have time with 1 on 1s across the rest of the lone and get the ball out or gash us up the middle in the run game. 

tl;dr Gary for his contract isnt performing the way you'd want against the pass especially with the amount of attention that parsons draws and also is just not on the field very much compared to his other high earning peers",124671.0,negative

I am a NJ Packers fan since birth and I was at the game at Metlife last Sunday against the Giants wearing my cheesehead. Sometime in the third quarter I felt a tap on my head and heard “Hey Cheesehead turn around”, 

I turned around and saw a man, not wearing any specific team clothing just a normal black jacket. He said “$500 for your cheese hat right now?”. I said “What? Show me the money.” This man whipped out $500 in cash and handed it right to me. What else could I do…. I took the cheese right off my head and handed it over before even taking a second to think about it. He put it on his head and disappeared out of the section like nothing ever happened, not saying another word.

I have never been more confused in my life, and the people around me just stared and screamed in confusion as well. Yes, I feel like a sellout for that but I ordered a new one for the fantastic price of $27 after tax right when I got home. 

I took it to the bank and the bills were real. Why did this man give me $500 for my piece of foam?

Post Eagles game there was SO MUCH national sports media content along the lines of ""Jordan Love is the problem"", ""Packers have a qb problem"", ""Packers wont get anywhere  with Jordan Love"", ect.

Now look at the response to Jared Goff's objectively worse performance against the same Eagles defense; Lions fans were critical of his performance yet the national sports media response is trying to defelect blame from him. ""Jared Goff shouldn't be blamed for Lions offensive woes"".

Point is, in today's sports media so much content revolves around having strong opinions, weather correct or incorrect is irrelevant, just make it a hot take.

For whatever reason, Jordan Love has garnered a lot of negative takes from major talking heads.  As more  Packer fans have gotten on board the Love train, the fervent defense of his play by said fans has grown stronger.",1321031.0,positive

There’s entirely too much animosity in threads like this. Honestly yall. If you want to hate on J Love that bad, go wild. But it’s very true that if you include catches that absolutely should have been made, the guy was very good. Usually he is very good. He’s our guy for the foreseeable future imo. I think people here sometimes just deeply want to rag on the team they root for. Not every qb is Rodgers. That doesn’t mean love is bad. Though man I have to say sometimes when he throws a pick it’s real bad. But he’s also been under duress much of the season, and a lot of his worst decisions came in chaotic plays. 

Anyhow. I suggest we all try to root for his success. See what he does well, which is a lot of things. It’s way more fun than spending your sundays talking shit about your team and qb.",155415.0,positive

Point is Love is that guy which is no secret to most of the people in this sub that know anything about football, but he continues to get over hated or overlooked altogether. Love is a good quarterback, I think what makes people critical about him is that we were spoiled by Aaron Rodgers for years who is basically a QB god. Love for whatever reason makes some really stupid decisions sometimes, something Rodgers never really did; Love also seems to struggle with football IQ/reads at times but I think what makes it so noticeable to us is that Rodgers had an insane football IQ so we tend to pick up on the things Love misses on even more because Rodgers never would miss on those things. The thing that really throws me off about Love is his inconsistent deep ball though. Sometimes he throws these amazing dimes into coverage and other times his deep balls look like random Hail Mary throws into double/triple coverage that just leave you wondering wtf he was thinking, I find it somewhat concerning that he still hasn’t nailed that down after all these years. All that being said I think Love is awesome and any team would be happy to have him, however we were insanely spoiled with Aaron Rodgers and so we tend to compare everything to him and Love ain’t no Aaron Rodgers..",155415.0,positive

They do this in all divisions every year. Division games impact playoff races more than anything else and this allows the nfl to pick and choose which games to televise to maximize ratings. 

The division realignment back in 2002 eliminated the central divisions in favor of North South East and West creating a clean, symmetrical divisional system. This made for a much better product and provided a simple way to ensure all teams play each other on a regular rotation. Weighting division games to the back half of the season started the same time.

Of his six drives (ignoring the drive he was hurt on his only pass was ANOTHER drop erased by  penalty) 

They would score on three of them two would end in perfect passes being dropped. One exception to this is the final drive of the first half which went as followed- 

first down conversion throw to Doubs Walker was instantly beat on protection, a incomplete contested catch Morgan was dog walked back into Loves lap, a bad snap Jordan recovered and tossed to Musgrave who dropped it, finally well covered play Love is about to seize the day light if he does its most likely a first down but he gets stepped on the last possible second and falls resulting in a sack.

 He's consistent. You know what you're gonna get with Love. He's only had 2 300+ yard games. Not a single 400+ yard game this season. But there's only 3 INTs. 13 completions on 24 attempts in the last game isn't that impressive (season low for completions and yards). 

The problem is not Love. It's the supporting cast on offense. Every position is struggling to find consistency at the moment.",247212.0,positive

 I agree it was a great showing of his talent. Without those drops his praises would have been sung from the espn roof tops. He needs to be trusted more. 24 passing attempts per game is not the way this team needs to be trending. Run opens the pass and pass opens the run. Right now we are too run heavy and predictable.

 It happens most games, but this one really had me thinking “If I was watching an opposing QB make throws like this the receiver comes down with it.” Feels like if Goff/Dak/Mahomes/Hurts/whoever sends this type of ball to their receiver you know they are getting the 1st down they shouldn’t have, where with the packers it’s a 50/50 on ecstasy or heartbreak.",41202.0,neutral

 Rodgers REALLY spoiled this fanbase. It’s insane how many Packers fans are STILL saying Love “sucks” and to start Malik. Love has more than proven he is our franchise QB and has had to make up for a ton of deficiencies with the offense.


-No true WR1 (closest thing to it is Kraft and he’s out for the season).

-Countless drops by WRs (lead the league in drops last year and while they started off good this year, there have been a ton of drops the last couple games).

-Makeshift o-line that has been struggling a lot this year with not only protecting Love, but also opening up running lanes for Jacobs.

-Very stale and predictable play-calling, especially in gotta-have-it situations.


Despite all of this, Love is still top 10 in most statistical categories this year, top 5 in some. He passes the eye test too. It’s like some of our “fans” just WANT him to fail for some bizarre reason. It’s stupid.",41202.0,neutral

 Interesting thing is that Love pretty consistently does better in metrics like EPA/play than he does in PFF grade (where he's still above average).

I'm not sure I can think of a truly bad play from yesterday though. If an incompletion wasn't a drop, it was a throwaway to save a sack following instant pressure. And the one play that was risky but worked out anyways was the Willis TD pass, so no chance to Love to get dinged with a poor grade on a play that worked out well anyways.",33592.0,neutral

I think the Packers/Broncos game is going to be huge. Playoff style game. For the Pack it will be for the NFC north. The difference between being #1 or #2. I think you're the better team vs the three others. But Chicago currently has the #1 spot.

Short of the Lions or Bears getting a Tie somewhere, Tiebreakers don’t matter. We either win the Division on our Record, or we lose the Division on our record.

Vikings look very beatable right now. I chalk that up as two “Likely” wins.

We can beat the Lions. Just need the defense to execute and the offense to function. I’d call that a Tossup game.

Bears have been strong in the Fourth Quarter but shaky the rest of the game. If we can build a lead against them, we can win. I give it one Likely win, one tossup win.

Broncos have looked very shaky. Exceptional Defense, Mediocre Offense. Tossup game in my book.

Ravens… I honestly have no idea at this point. It heavily depends on whether they’re in playoff contention. If they’re fired up to try and clinch the playoffs expect a tough game. Tossup.

We probably need to lose no more than 2 games if we want a shot at the Division, and we’d need to win all three games against the Lions and Bears for that to be the case. I think we can afford to lose against the Broncos and Ravens, assuming we sweep the division. Otherwise, it’ll get ugly.",28814.0,positive

Love is still the best overall QB in the division. Goof’s seeming inability to handle any kind of pressure is insanely detrimental and puts a hard ceiling on the Lions. and god forbid Amon are or Jame-O goes down. they may get lucky and get through the playoffs without facing a good D, but unlikely. Eagles, Rams, and/or Seahawks all in waiting. Ben bounced once he understood this 

Love is just about having consistency. elite QBs can still make it work with different O lineman, receivers, etc but Love is not that. just a really good all around QB that has the capability of making all of the throws. lots of important drops yesterday for Love. Giants D is sneaky good 

Caleb showing signs but the truth is somewhere between the Week 3 takes and last week’s take. need to see him handle the pressure a little better, but there is vast improvements. timing routes over the middle improving as well. lots of important drops for Caleb last couple of weeks 

JJ may not make it through the season. but small sample. need to see how these next 4-5 weeks go. he also had strange drops. Jones could have hauled in that TD. was a nice throw ",427858.0,positive

1ox3jul,1763143159.0,1284,0.92,30,Fandom,"2025 Packers Opponent Burger Series- Week 11- New York Giants Well, this one was certainly the most labor intensive burger so far this season. This is my take on Gruyère Cheeseburger au Jus from The Fulton by Jean-Georges. It's a fairly simple burger to the eye, but a lot of work in practice. You can think of this burger as an elevated French onion burger. The menu from the restaurant isn't the most descriptive, so I did my best to make my own version of this burger. 

They don't list what kind of bun they used, so I figured I'd lean into the defining flavor of this burger, and opted for toasted onion buns. The cheese is right there in the name, Gruyère Cheeseburger au Jus. The menu lists a ""chili dijon mayo,"" but they don't mention what kind of chilis. For the mayo I used: 

1 egg Yolk

1 tbsp lemon juice

1 tbsp dijon

1 tsp of Calabrian chili

A pinch of salt

A small pinch of pepper

A smaller pinch of MSG

3/4 cup of avocado oil

Just like any other mayo, combine your non-oil ingredients in a food processor, and run until combined, then slowly add in your oil until the emulsion is created. 

This burger also has fried onions smashed into the patties. I had enough leftover that I decided to throw some on top of the patty too. The onions were thinly sliced, and marinated in buttermilk before dredging in flour seasoned with togarashi, paprika, Cayenne, cumin, salt, pepper, and MSG. Then they were just fried until golden. 

The last component of this burger was also the reason it took so long to make. You're given a small cup of jus for dipping. For this I made a pretty basic beef stock in my instant pot. I browned my soup bones on the sautee setting before adding, two onions, a couple ribs of celery, a few small carrots (including a small amount of the carrot greens), shiitake mushrooms, a few garlic cloves, a small handful of peppercorns, a few sprigs of thyme, and enough water to cover. Then I pressure cooked it for two hours. After straining out the solids, I chilled it so that I could more easily skim the fat off the top. 

The next day I simmered the stock with more raw onion until it was approximately a quarter to a third of the previous volume (this took a good chunk of the day). I strained out the solids again, added salt and sugar until I got the seasoning right, then I called an audible. Instead of leaving it a broth, I mounted the heavily reduced stock with a  knob of butter and vigorously stirred to emulsify. Doing this gave it the more velvety texture, kind of like a pan sauce. 

This burger was decadent. That's really all there is to say. It ended up probably a bit too salty, but it was delicious. I learned about this burger through a local chef who is active in the Twin Cities burger community because he added his own version to his restaurant's menu, and I've loved the concept of it ever since. Granted, a lot of that is because I LOVE onion.  Looks incredible, seems like a ton of effort for at-home cooking though.",36620.0,positive

If it had been me, I wouldn’t have mounted the jus. Think French Dip or Beef on Weck and how thin those sauces are. The way it soaks into and slightly compromises the integrity of the bun is what I personally like so much about a jus vs a pan sauce. Being that this was a burger from a French restaurant and from a state (yes, yes, giants play in New Jersey - we’re ignoring that) that has Beef on Weck (and we’re also ignoring that the Bills exist 😅), I’d have stuck with the simple jus. The pan sauce “elevates” it too much, imo.

I browned my soup bones on the sautee setting before adding, two onions, a couple ribs of celery, a few small carrots (including a small amount of the carrot greens), shiitake mushrooms, a few garlic cloves, a small handful of peppercorns, a few sprigs of thyme, and enough water to cover. Then I pressure cooked it for two hours. After straining out the solids, I chilled it so that I could more easily skim the fat off the top. 

The next day I simmered the stock with more raw onion until it was approximately a quarter to a third of the previous volume (this took a good chunk of the day). I strained out the solids again, added salt and sugar until I got the seasoning right, then I called an audible. Instead of leaving it a broth, I mounted the heavily reduced stock with a  knob of butter and vigorously stirred to emulsify. Doing this gave it the more velvety texture, kind of like a pan sauce. 

This burger was decadent. That's really all there is to say. It ended up probably a bit too salty, but it was delicious. I learned about this burger through a local chef who is active in the Twin Cities burger community because he added his own version to his restaurant's menu, and I've loved the concept of it ever since.

Before the Kraft injury, in 2 TE sets, the 2nd TE is Musgrave if they’re passing and Fitzgerald if they’re running.

That year, the family got Green Bay Packers season tickets and decided to use them to honor Todd’s memory.

“My son had Duchenne muscular dystrophy. He was in a wheelchair. We applied for season tickets, but he passed away before he got them. We knew Todd was going to succumb early in life. And I basically decided, you know, that wasn’t the time to cry about it,” said Craig, Todd’s father and co-founder of Wheel of Todd, a nonprofit that donates handicap tickets for Packers home games to children with disabilities.

That mindset turned into the Bells giving other families the experience of a lifetime at Lambeau Field.

“We didn’t want to just give them the tickets. We wanted them to have everything as free as possible. So, we give them a motel room for two nights. We give them $1,000 to spend anywhere they want. And we drive five hours to come here to put on a tailgate party and roll out the red carpet for them, like my friends did to our son,” said Craig.

Before the Bells got season tickets, Todd said he didn’t want to go to Packers games in the cold.

“He said, ‘Well, Dad, what would you do with the other tickets?’ I go, ‘Well, maybe I could sell them, or maybe I could donate them,'” Craig recalled. “\[Todd said\], ‘Oh my God, Dad, that would be so cool if you donated those tickets.'”

Since then, the Bells have donated tickets for 42 Packers games.

“The smiles that the kids get, and then the parents usually start crying, and it’s like we’re instantly bonded,” said Bell.

Hannah Otto has muscular dystrophy.

“Me and my mom had a very rough year. I had a lot going on along with graduating, and my mom’s been really sick and in and out of the hospitals. So, I basically wrote in how I wanted this to be like a big experience, where I can make a bunch of memories with my mom,” said Otto.

“I was driving home from a doctor’s appointment, and she called me and she was crying so hard I could barely understand her. She’s like, ‘I won tickets to a Packers game, Mom!’ She was so excited,” said Shannon Larrabee, Hannah’s mother.

In exchange for the donated tickets, Craig and Julie ask for one simple thing in return.

“Just a picture of them holding a sign that says, ‘Thank you, Todd.’ That’s all we want,” said Craig.

For those given the experience of a lifetime, they’re more than happy to say thank you to Todd.

“Me and my mom had a very rough year. I had a lot going on along with graduating, and my mom’s been really sick and in and out of the hospitals. So, I basically wrote in how I wanted this to be like a big experience, where I can make a bunch of memories with my mom,” said Otto.

“I was driving home from a doctor’s appointment, and she called me and she was crying so hard I could barely understand her. She’s like, ‘I won tickets to a Packers game, Mom!’ She was so excited,” said Shannon Larrabee, Hannah’s mother.

In exchange for the donated tickets, Craig and Julie ask for one simple thing in return.

“Just a picture of them holding a sign that says, ‘Thank you, Todd.’ That’s all we want,” said Craig.

For those given the experience of a lifetime, they’re more than happy to say thank you to Todd.

That year, the family got Green Bay Packers season tickets and decided to use them to honor Todd’s memory.

“My son had Duchenne muscular dystrophy. He was in a wheelchair. We applied for season tickets, but he passed away before he got them. We knew Todd was going to succumb early in life. And I basically decided, you know, that wasn’t the time to cry about it,” said Craig, Todd’s father and co-founder of Wheel of Todd, a nonprofit that donates handicap tickets for Packers home games to children with disabilities.

That mindset turned into the Bells giving other families the experience of a lifetime at Lambeau Field.

“We didn’t want to just give them the tickets. We wanted them to have everything as free as possible. So, we give them a motel room for two nights. We give them $1,000 to spend anywhere they want. And we drive five hours to come here to put on a tailgate party and roll out the red carpet for them, like my friends did to our son,” said Craig.

Before the Bells got season tickets, Todd said he didn’t want to go to Packers games in the cold.

“He said, ‘Well, Dad, what would you do with the other tickets?’ I go, ‘Well, maybe I could sell them, or maybe I could donate them,'” Craig recalled. “\[Todd said\], ‘Oh my God, Dad, that would be so cool if you donated those tickets.'”

Everything they offer, from the hotel room to the tailgate to the spending money, feels like a way of saying Todd’s name with love instead of sorrow. And that simple request for a photo saying “Thank you, Todd” turns each game into a small, living tribute to him.

1ow4t0o,1763056454.0,700,0.99,21,Fandom,"Family honors late son by donating handicap Packers season tickets to children with disabilities Craig and Julie Bell lost their son, Todd, to complications from muscular dystrophy in 2012.

That year, the family got Green Bay Packers season tickets and decided to use them to honor Todd’s memory.

“My son had Duchenne muscular dystrophy. He was in a wheelchair. We applied for season tickets, but he passed away before he got them. We knew Todd was going to succumb early in life. And I basically decided, you know, that wasn’t the time to cry about it,” said Craig, Todd’s father and co-founder of Wheel of Todd, a nonprofit that donates handicap tickets for Packers home games to children with disabilities.

That mindset turned into the Bells giving other families the experience of a lifetime at Lambeau Field.

“We didn’t want to just give them the tickets. We wanted them to have everything as free as possible. So, we give them a motel room for two nights. We give them $1,000 to spend anywhere they want. And we drive five hours to come here to put on a tailgate party and roll out the red carpet for them, like my friends did to our son,” said Craig.

Before the Bells got season tickets, Todd said he didn’t want to go to Packers games in the cold.

“He said, ‘Well, Dad, what would you do with the other tickets?’ I go, ‘Well, maybe I could sell them, or maybe I could donate them,'” Craig recalled. “\[Todd said\], ‘Oh my God, Dad, that would be so cool if you donated those tickets.'”

Since then, the Bells have donated tickets for 42 Packers games.

“The smiles that the kids get, and then the parents usually start crying, and it’s like we’re instantly bonded,” said Bell.

Hannah Otto has muscular dystrophy.

“Me and my mom had a very rough year. I had a lot going on along with graduating, and my mom’s been really sick and in and out of the hospitals. So, I basically wrote in how I wanted this to be like a big experience, where I can make a bunch of memories with my mom,” said Otto.

“I was driving home from a doctor’s appointment, and she called me and she was crying so hard I could barely understand her. She’s like, ‘I won tickets to a Packers game, Mom!’ She was so excited,” said Shannon Larrabee, Hannah’s mother.

In exchange for the donated tickets, Craig and Julie ask for one simple thing in return.

We have seen some brilliant moments from him during the season. But this time we got to see a down game and some of his weaknesses. Now, the fact that he had a bad game wasn't entirely his fault because the play calling was bad and the offensive line was a mixture of injured and bad. But there were some things under his control he did not handle well. 

I will just point out one of them for the sake of brevity. One of the most important skills a QB must master is knowing what to do with the ball when pressured or in the middle of hopeless situations. He made some poor decisions by trying to force some plays, but the main thing he did not do well was safely get rid of the ball. He sometimes struggles with this. Rodgers was the king of knowing what to do with the ball in hopeless situations, however Love has never really mastered this skill. He's been in the league for a while now and this is one thing he should be better at by now.",53173.0,negative

Only our fan base would be unhappy with LoVe and only our team would have Love shit talked. Remove the fucking Rodgers and Favre bias rose tinted glasses. Love is AT WORST SERVICEABLE. He’s better than the fucking qb battle of purdy and jones in sf at minimum as well and that woulda been good enough performance wise for most last year. 

Consider if you upset that love isn’t Rodgers or Favre yet before hating on him fr. It’s fucking tiring at this point. Mfer has better stats than both at this point btw as well. On pace to be another gb hof qb but everyone can’t take lafleurs dick out their mouth

And edit: I’m in zero way saying love is better than Favre or Rodgers btw. I have Rodgers as my goat. But it is factually statistically true that love is better at the start than they were. Give him some time and maybe blame the plays that are being yelled out by the defense not our still young qb. 


Shoulda had a ring w Rodgers and lafleur but he miss coached Tampa game. Rodgers played mid but Brady played worse. Anyyyyyy other Hc fires ST coordinator before playoffs w it being that bad and 32/32 in the league. Even still just so many bad coaching mistakes or play calls that game…",39880.0,negative

The O line wasn’t the best but also it wasn’t as bad as people say, there’s so many drop backs where the pocket gets caved in a little but there’s still a pocket to throw and Love bails.

HOWEVER, let's consider a few things.

**1. the offense doesn't suck.** 

it has hit a lull lately, but in the Panthers loss they actually drove the ball at will. They had a bad fumble, missed FG, and a dumb INT ruin three of their drives and then MLF got overly aggressive on 4th and 8 when they should have settled for a FG.

despite a trainwreck, they only lost by 3.

**2. this team has scored 27+ points in every non loss**

Green Bay's offense is not ""awful"". It just isn't perfect. the o-line has been banged up and inconsistent all year. that's led to a less than potent ground game, which bleeds into protection and what they can do down the field in the passing game.

oh, and they have not been healthy in the passing game in terms of weaponry, either. Reed died immediately, Watson only got back 3 games ago, and Golden is a rookie who has now been battling injuries or didn't play the past 2 weeks.

**3. the defense is elite (but not perfect)**

I think it's because we're packers fans, but if you actually watch even the best NFL defenses, they GASP do still give up first downs, big plays, and touchdowns.

Green Bay's defense is not perfect, but it is very, very good. they grade out well against both the pass and the run and that defense has kept them in their 3 losses, giving them a shot when the offense was just not getting it done.

Green Bay had one truly bad game on defense all year and that was on the road against a talented and desperate Cowboys team.

**4. Jordan Love is fine**

Love makes dumb plays, to be sure, but he is very good with a clean pocket, and even in a horrendous performance on MNF, still bounced back to make some clutch throws and put the Packers in position to win or tie

he has been mostly great this year. no QBs have been 100% elite throughout the year. the only ones that comes close are Darnold and Stafford and even they both have had some questionable moments.

**5. firing MLF isn't it**

lastly, I don't think canning MLF or stripping him of playcalling duties is the answer. I think the Packers have a talented roster that is inconsistent and he's trying to do the best he can with what's in front of him. sometimes he looks like a genius and sometimes penalties, turnovers, missed FGs, or dropped passes combine to pressure him into some questionable decision-making.

I hated the 4th down play at the end of the game, so you definitely can roast him for that. but more often than not he has the packers looking solid on offense and literally has had them in position to win every single game this year.

overall, a ton of Green Bay's issues stem from health and execution. they are still one of the best teams in the NFC and they control their destiny.

Green Bay's defense is not perfect, but it is very, very good. they grade out well against both the pass and the run and that defense has kept them in their 3 losses, giving them a shot when the offense was just not getting it done.

Green Bay had one truly bad game on defense all year and that was on the road against a talented and desperate Cowboys team.

**4. Jordan Love is fine**

Love makes dumb plays, to be sure, but he is very good with a clean pocket, and even in a horrendous performance on MNF, still bounced back to make some clutch throws and put the Packers in position to win or tie

he has been mostly great this year. no QBs have been 100% elite throughout the year. the only ones that comes close are Darnold and Stafford and even they both have had some questionable moments.

**5. firing MLF isn't it**

lastly, I don't think canning MLF or stripping him of playcalling duties is the answer. I think the Packers have a talented roster that is inconsistent and he's trying to do the best he can with what's in front of him. sometimes he looks like a genius and sometimes penalties, turnovers, missed FGs, or dropped passes combine to pressure him into some questionable decision-making.

I hated the 4th down play at the end of the game, so you definitely can roast him for that. but more often than not he has the packers looking solid on offense and literally has had them in position to win every single game this year.

overall, a ton of Green Bay's issues stem from health and execution. they are still one of the best teams in the NFC and they control their destiny. 

now, if they lose to the Giants....

 This team is built (and is playing) like a team that HAS to be playing with a lead. If we get behind on the scoreboard, even to bad teams, we fall apart.

Predictable playcalling. Silly high peaks and silly low valleys in overall team performance. MLF's horrible game sense and clock management. 

I'm fine with QB's (or anyone) doing dumb shit. It happens. But Love has to STOP doing dumb shit in the worst moments. I would 100% take him NOT doing dumb shit in the worst moments even if it meant his play otherwise was only average. 

  
Our defense (especially secondary) is suspect when the front can't get pressure. When the opposing teams can drop back and have 5+ seconds to work through progressions.... they get eaten up. 

Special teams has been an issue. If Mcmanus isn't 100% then he shouldn't be kicking until he is. I was actually pleased with his first attempt at that very long, late field goal when they called the TO. He was about a foot off of actually making it. Obviously the second one the snap was horrible and the kick was dogshit but he had a real shot at that career long / team long FG.",246922.0,positive

HOWEVER, let's consider a few things.

**1. the offense doesn't suck.** 

it has hit a lull lately, but in the Panthers loss they actually drove the ball at will. They had a bad fumble, missed FG, and a dumb INT ruin three of their drives and then MLF got overly aggressive on 4th and 8 when they should have settled for a FG.

despite a trainwreck, they only lost by 3.

**2. this team has scored 27+ points in every non loss**

Green Bay's offense is not ""awful"". It just isn't perfect. the o-line has been banged up and inconsistent all year. that's led to a less than potent ground game, which bleeds into protection and what they can do down the field in the passing game.

oh, and they have not been healthy in the passing game in terms of weaponry, either. Reed died immediately, Watson only got back 3 games ago, and Golden is a rookie who has now been battling injuries or didn't play the past 2 weeks.

 I have heard you out and you are wrong. 

It's this type of mentality that will end with us looking back in five years wondering what the heck happened. The same as the ""it's ok, we are the youngest team in the NFL"" narrative. 

We have major problems with 2 minute drill execution, pre snap penalties, and questionable play calling in timely situations. Losing Kraft and Jenkins is a huge deal. Jacobs has not been the same since his calf strain. We still are sloppy on special teams. And Jordan still is too inconsistent for us to simply brush it off as ""oh, he'll be better once he gets his weapons back."" We are quickly headed to another playoff performance where we make the same excuses of ""more weapons!"" or "" if not for Injuries!"". 

I'm not saying I have the solutions, but would definitely not categorize things as ""fine"".",246922.0,positive

 Last game was hard to watch.  My understanding was that they were consistently getting split safety coverage (double high safety?), so they try to beat that with the run game.  The run game just wasn't able to do anything to ever get them out of that coverage.  Ideally they run it until they defend the run, then Love goes deep.

I didn't see much done (or at least much done sucessfully) in the short passing game.  Love did the classic AR strategy of drop way back and run around until things go from bad to worse.  I think the Packers could have taken a hint from Carolina and relied on short, quick passes to negate the pass rush/poor OL play.  The short passes the Packers tend to favor seem to be screens that go nowhere.  Where are the quick outs and crossers?",67342.0,negative

I think the Packers have a talented roster that is inconsistent and he's trying to do the best he can with what's in front of him. sometimes he looks like a genius and sometimes penalties, turnovers, missed FGs, or dropped passes combine to pressure him into some questionable decision-making.

I hated the 4th down play at the end of the game, so you definitely can roast him for that. but more often than not he has the packers looking solid on offense and literally has had them in position to win every single game this year.

overall, a ton of Green Bay's issues stem from health and execution. they are still one of the best teams in the NFC and they control their destiny. 

now, if they lose to the Giants....

 I've been a MLF fan up until lately. I feel like he's lost his way and is constantly second guessing decisions and has coached very defensively and predictably. I'm not sure if he's lost faith in his personnel or feels like he's coaching for his job but i don't get any sense of confidence or assertiveness from him.",112238.0,negative

HOWEVER, let's consider a few things.

**1. the offense doesn't suck.** 

it has hit a lull lately, but in the Panthers loss they actually drove the ball at will. They had a bad fumble, missed FG, and a dumb INT ruin three of their drives and then MLF got overly aggressive on 4th and 8 when they should have settled for a FG.

despite a trainwreck, they only lost by 3.

**2. this team has scored 27+ points in every non loss**

Green Bay's offense is not ""awful"". It just isn't perfect. the o-line has been banged up and inconsistent all year. that's led to a less than potent ground game, which bleeds into protection and what they can do down the field in the passing game.

oh, and they have not been healthy in the passing game in terms of weaponry, either. Reed died immediately, Watson only got back 3 games ago, and Golden is a rookie who has now been battling injuries or didn't play the past 2 weeks.

**3. the defense is elite (but not perfect)**

I think it's because we're packers fans, but if you actually watch even the best NFL defenses, they GASP do still give up first downs, big plays, and touchdowns.

Green Bay's defense is not perfect, but it is very, very good. they grade out well against both the pass and the run and that defense has kept them in their 3 losses, giving them a shot when the offense was just not getting it done.

Green Bay had one truly bad game on defense all year and that was on the road against a talented and desperate Cowboys team.

**4. Jordan Love is fine**

Love makes dumb plays, to be sure, but he is very good with a clean pocket, and even in a horrendous performance on MNF, still bounced back to make some clutch throws and put the Packers in position to win or tie

he has been mostly great this year. no QBs have been 100% elite throughout the year. the only ones that comes close are Darnold and Stafford and even they both have had some questionable moments.

 The NFL has found the issues with the offense as they stand right now.  Our O line isn't going to effectively move people in the run game, so no huge concerns there and they don't need to add bodies to stop it (plus if they go lighter boxes the Packers are going to ineffectively run at them all night until forced to be aggressive).  Play a lot of shell coverages and zone.  The passing offense will move the ball between the 20's reasonably well against that but in the red zone will really struggle.  There are a lot of ways that could change but early in the season they relied on YAC from Kraft and they don't really have another guy who has shown the knack for it.",44895.0,negative

 If GB likes to boast about having the youngest roster in the League every year, than why is our offense so confusing for the players that they can't get lined up right, false-start all the damn time?  And why is does a play call take 30 seconds to read out loud only to get 1 yard?

now, if they lose to the Giants....

 I want to address your points about the offense in particular. 

You mentioned yourself, even against a mid Carolina defense, we’re fumbling the ball, missing kicks, throwing bad INTs (it should have been two but Love’s birthday miracle was that the ball he threw directly to a safety to 10 yards of clearance somehow wasn’t a pick), and you didn’t even mention that in the red zone, our lack of discipline at the line of scrimmage backed us up 15+ yards costing us a much much easier look at a touchdown. 

On top of that, no Kraft, no Reed, no Golden last week and losing Doubs late against Philly has us throwing passes to fucking Bo Melton. The offense has shown promise this season, but right now, it looks broken. 

None of that is to even mention the play calling. LaFleur wants so damn badly for this to be a power running team with Jacobs. Jacobs is a fantastic RB, but if teams know the script for 60 minutes is two inside zones followed by either a screen or a deep ball to Watson, they can sell out against Jacobs and keep him from making an impact, and teams have clearly figured that out. LaFleur is fucking predictable rn.

Love is *also* not in control of this offense. The hurry up call on 4th and 1 late against Philly can only be the result of two possibilities: 

1. LaFleur is playing Shanahan ball and not allowing Love to make changes at the LOS/not sending him up there with a secondary call

Or 

2. Love doesn’t have the mental prowess to *make* those types of diagnoses at the LOS and desperately needs to develop his mental game.

To your point about our wins all coming with 27+ points, while that is true, we’ve put up 13 and 7 in the last two weeks, that’s where we are in the present moment. I’ll admit, I was looking for one person to blame after this second loss in a row, but the reality is that multiple factors have converged to cause the offense to stagnate. Missing multiple receivers, LaFleur calling games conservatively and Love not making adjustments at the LOS are all factors here.

All of these things need to be addressed in some way or another if this offense is going to see any success going forward.",44895.0,neutral

1outh4i,1762920899.0,27248,0.82,81,Analysis,"The Packers’ core problem is LaFleur’s identity, not just talent or scheme In my humble non-expert opinion, Green Bay’s main issue right now isn’t “no talent” or “bad scheme.” It’s that Matt LaFleur’s own football identity is internally inconsistent, and that inconsistency leaks into the team.

At his core, LaFleur is a cerebral, QB-centric offensive coach from the Shanahan/McVay tree: motion, condensed formations, play-action, using structure to create explosives, and leveraging a smart QB to run it. The peak Rodgers years under LaFleur are the proof of concept: hybrid scheme, high efficiency, back-to-back MVPs. His best football clearly comes when the offense is built around the quarterback in a structurally aggressive way.

The problem isn’t the absence of a system; it’s what he does with that system when stakes rise. In big moments (championship games, key 4th downs, end-of-game decisions), he often regresses to a conservative default: takes the ball out of the QB’s hands, leans on “play it safe,” or tries to win via “system ball” and defense. At the same time, he frequently pushes toward a run-first, wide-zone vision even when the roster (OL, QB, WR group) is better suited to a more pass-leaning, QB-driven approach. The result is a HC whose identity in theory is QB-centric and aggressive, but whose instinct under pressure is conservative and system-centric.

That wobble shows up on the field. Teams with a clear identity impose their style on weaker opponents and keep playing their game in big spots. The Packers instead often play to the level of the competition, oscillate between aggressive and timid gameplans, and melt down in high-leverage situations. Players feel when a coach preaches “trust the QB, be aggressive” all week and then, on the decisive snaps, acts like he doesn’t trust that premise. It creates a diffuse message: what are we actually trying to be?

This doesn’t mean LaFleur is a bad coach. He’s a good-to-very-good offensive mind with a proven track record of efficient units and QB development. The issue is that he hasn’t resolved the conflict between his QB-centric essence and his conservative reflex under pressure plus his attachment to an abstract idea of “how the offense should look.”

The path forward is conceptually simple (though not easy):

1. Explicitly embrace a QB-centric identity: the system exists to maximize the QB, not to prove that it works without one.

2. Lock in a coherent risk philosophy (4th downs, red zone, 2-minute) and stick to it when it’s uncomfortable, not just against weak opponents.

3. Adjust the system to the roster, rather than forcing the roster into an idealized system (e.g., accept if the OL/QB profile points to a pass-leaning identity).

Until LaFleur fully commits to living and dying with his QB and aligns his risk tolerance with that choice, the Packers will keep reflecting his ambivalence: stretches of very good offense, punctuated by meltdowns that are less “random collapses” and more the predictable output of an unresolved identity at the top. I don’t think I’ve heard anyone so clearly articulate everything I’ve felt about the packer’s offense the past few years. This is it. This is the problem.",1832156.0,positive

I said this last year. This is old news. The issue is Jacobs doesn’t fit this team’s 2023 identity and that’s when their offense was at its best. 

Jacobs is not a 10-12 carry per game guy. He literally would be a non factor if that’s all he got the ball. Aaron Jones was a 10–12 carry per game guy and would get you 60-70 yards on that and a few long screens. Jacobs turned the wrong way last night on a screen that likely goes for 50.

I’m not blaming Jacobs, he is who he is. He is really good, too! However, I don’t know who you blame…Gute for signing a back who doesn’t fit our offense or MLF for not making it work with Jacobs. 

We were a pass first team in 23 and really every year with Rodgers. We are now a run first team this year and last year. So you tell me who is to blame.",251747.0,neutral

The issue is that he hasn’t resolved the conflict between his QB-centric essence and his conservative reflex under pressure plus his attachment to an abstract idea of “how the offense should look.”

The path forward is conceptually simple (though not easy):

1. Explicitly embrace a QB-centric identity: the system exists to maximize the QB, not to prove that it works without one.

2. Lock in a coherent risk philosophy (4th downs, red zone, 2-minute) and stick to it when it’s uncomfortable, not just against weak opponents.

3. Adjust the system to the roster, rather than forcing the roster into an idealized system (e.g., accept if the OL/QB profile points to a pass-leaning identity).

Until LaFleur fully commits to living and dying with his QB and aligns his risk tolerance with that choice, the Packers will keep reflecting his ambivalence: stretches of very good offense, punctuated by meltdowns that are less “random collapses” and more the predictable output of an unresolved identity at the top. LaFleur ran that system bc he had a very cerebral QB, one of most cerebral since Brady/Manning. 

It's pretty clear he would rather play out of 12 or 21 personnel, create mismatches with TEs and RBs, and run the ball with Jacobs.

However your theory still applies. He still lacks a consistent identity on offense and looks like he's throwing darts at a board to call plays.",55944.0,negative
1outh4i,1762966255.0,416,0.82,81,Analysis,"The Packers’ core problem is LaFleur’s identity, not just talent or scheme In my humble non-expert opinion, Green Bay’s main issue right now isn’t “no talent” or “bad scheme.” It’s that Matt LaFleur’s own football identity is internally inconsistent, and that inconsistency leaks into the team.

At his core, LaFleur is a cerebral, QB-centric offensive coach from the Shanahan/McVay tree: motion, condensed formations, play-action, using structure to create explosives, and leveraging a smart QB to run it. The peak Rodgers years under LaFleur are the proof of concept: hybrid scheme, high efficiency, back-to-back MVPs. His best football clearly comes when the offense is built around the quarterback in a structurally aggressive way.

The problem isn’t the absence of a system; it’s what he does with that system when stakes rise. In big moments (championship games, key 4th downs, end-of-game decisions), he often regresses to a conservative default: takes the ball out of the QB’s hands, leans on “play it safe,” or tries to win via “system ball” and defense. At the same time, he frequently pushes toward a run-first, wide-zone vision even when the roster (OL, QB, WR group) is better suited to a more pass-leaning, QB-driven approach. The result is a HC whose identity in theory is QB-centric and aggressive, but whose instinct under pressure is conservative and system-centric.

That wobble shows up on the field. Teams with a clear identity impose their style on weaker opponents and keep playing their game in big spots. The Packers instead often play to the level of the competition, oscillate between aggressive and timid gameplans, and melt down in high-leverage situations.

The issue is that he hasn’t resolved the conflict between his QB-centric essence and his conservative reflex under pressure plus his attachment to an abstract idea of “how the offense should look.”

The path forward is conceptually simple (though not easy):

1. Explicitly embrace a QB-centric identity: the system exists to maximize the QB, not to prove that it works without one.

2. Lock in a coherent risk philosophy (4th downs, red zone, 2-minute) and stick to it when it’s uncomfortable, not just against weak opponents.

3. Adjust the system to the roster, rather than forcing the roster into an idealized system (e.g., accept if the OL/QB profile points to a pass-leaning identity).

Until LaFleur fully commits to living and dying with his QB and aligns his risk tolerance with that choice, the Packers will keep reflecting his ambivalence: stretches of very good offense, punctuated by meltdowns that are less “random collapses” and more the predictable output of an unresolved identity at the top.

1outh4i,1762970228.0,208,0.82,81,Analysis,"The Packers’ core problem is LaFleur’s identity, not just talent or scheme In my humble non-expert opinion, Green Bay’s main issue right now isn’t “no talent” or “bad scheme.” It’s that Matt LaFleur’s own football identity is internally inconsistent, and that inconsistency leaks into the team.

At his core, LaFleur is a cerebral, QB-centric offensive coach from the Shanahan/McVay tree: motion, condensed formations, play-action, using structure to create explosives, and leveraging a smart QB to run it. The peak Rodgers years under LaFleur are the proof of concept: hybrid scheme, high efficiency, back-to-back MVPs. His best football clearly comes when the offense is built around the quarterback in a structurally aggressive way.

The problem isn’t the absence of a system; it’s what he does with that system when stakes rise. In big moments (championship games, key 4th downs, end-of-game decisions), he often regresses to a conservative default: takes the ball out of the QB’s hands, leans on “play it safe,” or tries to win via “system ball” and defense. At the same time, he frequently pushes toward a run-first, wide-zone vision even when the roster (OL, QB, WR group) is better suited to a more pass-leaning, QB-driven approach. The result is a HC whose identity in theory is QB-centric and aggressive, but whose instinct under pressure is conservative and system-centric.

That wobble shows up on the field. Teams with a clear identity impose their style on weaker opponents and keep playing their game in big spots. The Packers instead often play to the level of the competition, oscillate between aggressive and timid gameplans, and melt down in high-leverage situations. Players feel when a coach preaches “trust the QB, be aggressive” all week and then, on the decisive snaps, acts like he doesn’t trust that premise.

I tried to pitch the ball back to Jordan on the fumble, but at that point you're playing backyard football""  So many things went wrong on this play. Sadly, these are known issues that have gone unaddressed throughout Matt’s tenure in GB.

1. 2-minute drill clock management. This is 100% a glaring weakness of MLF and most concerning. It’s 4th and 2 with 1:30 left on the clock, 2 timeouts remain, in plus territory. The obvious move is to call a timeout immediately after Muskgrave goes down short of the first. The game hinges on this one play. Reach into your bag and win/lose the game on your terms. Why was the plan to rush to the line and try to catch the D offguard? Does MLF think we get bonus points for unused timeouts? Is he unsure/insecure about his ability to dial in the right play? It’s alarming that we’d rather try to slip one past the defense than dictate terms to win.

2. No audible nor timeout from Love. The Eagles are literally shouting the play, clearly the catch them offguard strategy had failed. Meanwhile Watson has 10 yrds of green grass in front of him. Shoot him a glance and hit him on a quick release. At the very least recognize the situation calls for a timeout as the plan has failed. Is the game still moving too fast for Love? He’s been clutch under pressure in the past. Not sure why he chose to execute the plan when all signs were pointing to failure.

3. The penalty. Another instance of lack of discipline. Not sure who the call was on, I suspect a WR in motion didn’t get set. Even if the plan was successful, we’re facing 4th and medium. Again, doing the totally normal and rational thing and calling a timeout solves this one.

1 worries me the most. MLF’s inability to manage the clock and effectively use timeouts has cost us a number of games.",985723.0,neutral

The fact that the eagles straight up called out the 4th down play because they already ran the same fucking play 4 times that game, in my opinion, should be a fireable offense. We could have called a timeout there but again MLF didn’t.

Bottom line: MLF is the reason for the offensive woes his entire tenure in GB and also the reason Rodgers would constantly audible out of idiotic plays. Also the reason we are NOT going to win a SB with MLF. He calls plays based on the offense he wants, not the offense he has.

Kicking has long been undervalued/misunderstood in the NFL, but these days with the analytics and data available in the HCs hands, there is no excuse at all for the ongoing issues we are seeing. 3 of our top 4 all time point scorers are kickers and we are just muddling through a shit show at that position right now.

They've fed McManus to the wolves (remember he was our hero/saviour just last season) by throwing him into unwinnable situations like last night's. 

We continue with Matt Orzech (the highest paid LS in the league if I'm not mistaken) yet he's been a key common denominator in a bunch of struggling kicking units, including a number of iffy snaps at key moments over these few years.

We're playing a close game offensive strategy without giving a care to special teams or clock management. If you look at the Chiefs who play a similar slow-ish strategy, they locked in a solid kicker and always seem to end games with the ball at the foot of their guy, in a situation they know he'll be comfortable with. I think MLF wants to be this, but we are doing nothing to manage possession when it gets to like 6 minutes left, then further to that we are not playing into the kicker's comfort areas - hell MLF says he doesn't talk to kickers, I guess he doesn't even know his guys' comfort area!

Morgan gets blown up into the backfield at the snap, and both Rhyan and Banks are on the ground at the handoff. Heavy regression on interior play from last year with Jenkins at LG, Myers at C, and Rhyan at RG.

Banks completely whiffs and falls down, luckily manages to still trip up the backer but the dlineman gets in the backfield and Rhyan pancakes him in the hole where we wanted to run the ball.  Jacobs tries to go to the right side but Jalen Carter annihilated Morgan off the ball and drives him into Jacobs.  Jacobs then tries to bounce outside but because the play was supposed to go backside Musgrave is funneling his man up field and runs right into Jacobs trying to bounce.  

So to recap, bad playcall by coach, bad pre play read and recognition by QB, absolutely awful execution by the oline on 4th and short with the game on the line.

But the thing about Jordan Love is he isn’t Aaron Rodgers. No one is. We will never ever ever have a QB like him again. Love has to get cooking. He’s like Baker Mayfield. He’s gonna have some head scratching throws but he’s also going to throw a 45 yarder the next play. This is Love’s super power. It’s his ability to create big plays. 

Some fans have to get out of this mindset that Love can’t make mistakes. With Rodgers that works. You can get away with him having to bail us out on 3rd down. Love needs more cracks at it.

 My biggest concern is how depleted the roster is. Our offense is a walking ICU. Our defense is banged up and missing folks.

Meanwhile the Eagles are coming in looking like they've got most everyone ready to roll, or at least their biggest weapons.

 Just wanted to mention that I’m not sure that Matt Lafleur feels like he needs to prove he can playcall. I feel like that’s something that the team isn’t even concerned about yet casual fans like you and I see as a glaring primary issue which is extremely problematic. Even if we win this next game I wouldn’t feel that confident we could beat the Eagles again come playoffs because Lafleur does not have that championship gear and intensity in him to inspire the team to that level. Realize this is somewhat of a tangent from the original post but we’re in such a frustrating position with Coach Lafleur in that he’s good enough to keep but not bad enough to fire. I always believe in the chance and possibility of change for the team so let’s see if we can turn some corners and pull a big one like this one out at least. GPG",13704.0,positive

The weather was miserable throughout but it really started pouring in OT.  The game ended after midnight local time.

This was a 'Milwaukee' season ticket holder game - one of the few times up til that point we had a true Monday night game - and also  long before the ticket markets changed the home game dynamics...so most everyone was looking forward to a 2-3 hour drive to get out of town and get home in addition to the 30-45 min walk back to the car.

For those not familiar with Wisconsin, there is one main highway between Milwaukee and Green Bay, I-43, and getting back to Milwaukee in the fog, rain and cold was one of the longest driving experiences of my life combined with far, far too many drivers being far more lubricated than normal.  It was stop and go til somewhere around the Ozaukee/Milwaukee Cty line.  Just imagine an endless series of headlights all going in one direction.

It’s a tricky spot where defense probably needs to keep shifting its mentality to give the offense more possessions.

I'm not sure why LaFleur is hell bent on establishing the run at any cost or keep these screens in the game.

It makes a tonne of sense to establish the run and screens can go for a lot of yards IF executed well. But we're well into the season and the O-Line and Offense have proven that they CANNOT execute it. We also seemingly cannot stop holding on these plays either.

That is not only on the players, but also on LaFleur as the HC and Playcaller as well as the position coaches and Steno as the OC.

When your players keep proving you every week that they are unable to be a team that can split the run and pass 50/50 and execute these exotic screens then why not adapt and do something else?

You're making it incredibly difficult for the offense when you're constantly in 3rd and long situations because you refuse to adapt or alter your plans.",14113.0,neutral

As a non-Wisconsin Packer's fan, I've seen the Packers three times in different stadiums. Most fans of other teams are great as well, but I've also met some bad apples. I've never heard a bad thing about Packers fans. (in one instance security removed someone for harassing us, I was a teenager at the time.)

Show up at Lambeau with a visiting team's jersey, and they hand you a brat and a beer.

Also, if you keep doing shots like that, it very well could be a forgettable weekend 😹😹😹

My seats are usually on the away side, and gets a good amount of visiting fans. I always make a point of welcoming them and chatting them up. There’s usually a little playful ribbing and everyone usually goes home having a great time (even though they more often than not go home with an L).

My family took the pilgrimage in 2006 when we thought it might be Brett Favre’s last playoff run. They were playing the Vikings, and the rivalry was super strong at that point. 

When we walked through the tailgate the fans from both teams were absolutely incredible. Packers fans would wave us over to have a beer, then Vikings fans next to them would start talking good natured shit about their brats being bigger, to come join them instead. Jokes all around. We could not move 20 feet towards the stadium without someone trying to feed us or give us a drink.

It was super striking how well Green Bay treats its visitors, and how (at least in this case) the visitors were happy to share the love of the game in such a historic place.

He hits Watson in stride on that deep pass (0:13 in this video) and it's a TD IMHO; instead its an underthrown ball that Watson happened to be in a good spot to catch.

Anyway, let's throw a screen pass to Savion Williams again!  To me it’s not really confusing. He’s shown what we’ve always known. Elite speed and hands. The targets and play design for him legit needs a 180. I’m convinced if you made him our number 1 or 2 read on play calls our offence would be so much better. There’s been numerous times where he’s clearly been like the 3rd read and Love has either had to get the ball out quick or something else happened and Golden has been wide open over the middle. Our offence sometimes makes it way harder than it needs to be. I know Doubs is consistent and Watson is an explosive threat but Golden can be all of that if you just prioritize it. Yes he’s a rookie and we have a lot of mouths to feed but first and foremost the design for him needs to change",502117.0,neutral

Anyway, let's throw a screen pass to Savion Williams again!  The Packers offensive line has been systemically poor. 

The more I think about this, the more I realize this team is absolutely a night and day different team when playing from ahead. Why? Most teams aren't as aggressive defensively when they are playing from behind. 

Our O line has been getting dominated. And at times our D line has been rather flat. When the O line is flat, we have to totally rely on our very young group of WR's (now we don't even have Kraft). When our D line isn't getting pressure, our secondary gets eaten up. 

It's a nightmare scenario for us to ever fall behind, especially more than one score. 

75% of the problems the packers have are players simply getting out played, notably the linemen. MLF's ALWAYS had game clock management issues. Special teams have been problematic for us spanning back to last season. Our offensive line has been very suspect at times. 

Realistically this team could very easily be 7-0-1 right now. 

The loss in Cleveland I 100% put on MLF and Love equally. Love doesn't throw that silly ball into triple coverage, punts and allows our defensive unit that played well all game go and finish it.... we win that game. MLF being smart enough to RUN THE BALL when we are up 10 nothing late in the game... well. That's his half the blame. The Falcons gave away a super bowl ring to Brady and the Pats by doing just that. So did Pete Carrol. He also gifted the Pats a superbowl by doing that dumb shit. 1st and goal with the leagues leading running back and you dial up a throw by Wilson that gets picked off.

This last outing, again, Love doesn't throw that stupid INT and we actually go for a field goal on 4th and 8 instead of trying to force a touch down. Could have ended up very different. 

  
Love's played a statistically great year. But he's also done some really stupid stupid shit too. Something an elite QB just can't do. I won't criticize him for failing to win a game. I will nail him to the cross for giving one away though.",251058.0,negative

 MLF is going to have to seriously adapt things without Kraft. He's the only player that generates consistent YAC on the copious amounts of throws at the LOS and then he's our best blocker as well. I'd like to think it may force MLF into more of a normal passing offence, but I'm really not holding out much hope.",12462278.0,neutral

 Here’s my take on MLF. When you get out of the scripted plays at the beginning of the game, MLF becomes an emotional play caller. Not a strategic one. That’s why he does dumb things like going for it on 4th and 8. Because he FEELS like we shoulda picked up the first down on the play before so he tries again, rather than kicking the field goal. It’s why he throws challenge flags when Stevie Wonder could see he’s wrong. 

He’s absolutely addicted to calling sideline to sideline plays. It seems like the only time we’re actually passing beyond the line of scrimmage, it’s 40 yard rainbows when all we need are three damn yards. 

He forces run plays even if it’s constantly into a wall. And the man REFUSES to adjust to what’s happening on the field until it’s late in the game or simply too late. 

MLF is a good coach when he wants to be. But he’s not playoff caliber. Hence the 3-5 record. The shit he pulls in these games against lesser teams will get us blown out in the playoffs.

Lastly MLF plays so scared sometimes, I honestly couldn’t even classify it as “playing not to lose”. It’s more like just going through the motions because he’s too afraid to do anything else.",37546608.0,negative

 Inconsistencies on offense are usually a sign of OL issues.  I didn't manage to watch the game yesterday, but the box scores seem to show a good number of OL penalties and some unsuccessful runs that both killed drives. To me, that sounds like OL issues.  

Seems like Elgton is struggling to adapt to C, Banks keeps getting injured, and RG is still somehow up for grabs, with Morgan and Rhyan not managing to find a groove.",11663414.0,negative

 The sideline to sideline plays worked against Pittsburgh. Kraft was all YAC. The issue is the line and the run game. Teams are just daring us to run, and we can’t do it. Also daring us to be methodical and we can’t do it. Line play has been wildly inconsistent plus untimely penalties. It’s frustrating but I gotta say the players are the ones fucking up as much as the coach.",5751821.0,negative

 Starting to feel like MLF is a coordinator miscast as a head coach. 

Seven years. This is his roster with his QB that he drafted & developed, with the free agents (good or bad) that Gutey brought in, and LaFleur designs and calls plays that don’t fit the strengths of the team. 

And that’s OUTSIDE of the head up ass in game decisions he makes all too often.

 Listen I get it, but let’s face it. The line played like shit. If we don’t execute up front we’re going to lose. Is there schematically a problem with the line? I don’t think so. I see guys getting beat 1:1 and not communicating when they need to. Lombardi would be rolling heads with how we didn’t execute up front.

 I honestly don’t know a lot about stenavich, but I’d like to see what it looks like when he calls a game. I don’t think Matt would ever give up play calling duties, but maybe a different set of eyes for a weekend would be good for them. But look at what Cleveland just did. A league wide respected coach, in Stefanski, just gave up play calling to his OC. Whether it’ll work or not is to be seen, but at least they’re trying something.

Meanwhile, what was working was short and intermediate throws to the middle of the field. Yes, the hardest part of the field to thrown to, yet Jordan Love has show time and time again that he can throw there confidently. Our one touchdown drive was when he started calling those. Way, way too late unfortunately.

Defense was not the problem here. Even if we weren’t getting pressure, defense only surrendered 16 points. Offense whiffed and got zilch on way too many red zone trips.

Micah Parsons! When you’ve changed all the other pieces and have this much talent but the team still looks the same you have to draw the line somewhere. Unprepared, undisciplined, bad game management, conservative play calling. He’s actually gotten _worse_ over the years. Enough is enough.

But to fire a head coach and cause even more inconsistency is just much more hurtful than anything. Please take off the doomer glasses and think of it rationally.  First off, like all Packer fans, we are all frustrated. Agree you just can’t fire MLF but someone in the Org ( Gute) needs to sit him down. Here me out:
1. He doesn’t have AR anymore, maybe this HC and QB are not the right match. 
2. We ALL don’t know if it is the play calling or the QB audabaling out, but throwing into triple coverage just can’t happen in year 3. 
3. MLF’s conservative playing for 3 points and relying on a no brainer FG (👀) all the time and against the 2 worst teams is a BIG problem. 
and……….
4. With the 2 minute timeout and 3 TO’s in your pocket (see #3) will not get us to the Playoffs. 
Yes, still the youngest team in the league, but maybe it will take a much more experienced coach. This team needs to learn how to flip the kill switch and close out a game decisively.

It’s his refusal to correct issues that’s driving everyone insane.  A few seasons ago it was Joe Barry, everyone in the world could see he was a problem and shouldn’t have even been hired but clearly should have been fired during the season.  Special teams has directly resulted in all of our losses this year, Rich Bisaccia should have been gone after the Browns fuck up.  McManus clearly rushed back because he could sense he was losing his job.  Lafleur needs to grow a fucking spine to take the next step as a head coach.  Fire Bisaccia today, cut McManus and bring back in Havrisik.  If we don’t miss that kick, we likely take the FG on 4th and 8 and are up 2 FGs to end the game leaving the panthers in a desperate drive needing a TD at the end of the game instead of a FG to win.

Tell me you don't know ball without telling me you don't know ball. Our defense gave up 16 points today. Of the 12 NFL games so far this week, 8 of them were lost by teams that scored more than 16 points. Holding your opponent to 16 points is a pretty good way to win in the NFL. You can't blame the defense for the fact that our offense scored 6 points on 3 red zone trips in the first half and McManus missed a field goal.",125798.0,negative

It was hella funny because like .3secs they knew I’m not from there lol. It was a good convo starter tho. The only advice I have for you is look at their weather ahead to give and idea and depending where you live (climate) , guess it’s more of how much of the weather they having can you tolerate. For example: Im from California, never been outside of California. In dec it was going to snow , “lightly” . I packed my family winter snow stuff . I get there , see people in t shirts one light layer of a jacket or sweater. I’m walking around the whole time like that and people laughing at us or started to chat friendly . We don’t get snow in cali , never been in the snow until then. So I didn’t know how cold it was , etc . (Again it’s more of what you bare in the climate) it was so cool tho to watch the game at night as it snowed (fucken cold af/ even w our gear), it honestly was magical. Better than Disney that we have out here in cali. If it’s snowing or what ever, advice is lots of hand warmers LOTS! And pick up some cardboard box or of that nature to put on the floor over the snow so you insulated better from it (old timer there shows me and my girl).",1252499.0,neutral

 I'm from Montana, plenty used to cold. I still double up on socks because I hate cold feet, hand warmers and gloves because I can't ever seen to find gloves that actually keep my hands warm.

It quotes him saying he didn't want to come to Green Bay, but it was the only contract offer he got. Obviously it worked out for Woodson and the team, but why did he get such a long-term deal if no one else wanted him? This is one of my favorite signings in Packers' history and one of my favorite Packers of all time, in part, because there is no way it ever should have happened.  Woodson was turning 30 years old and coming off two seasons where he had suffered significant leg injuries including a broken leg the prior season.  He'd had injury shortened seasons 3 of the prior 4 years and his production wasn't that impressive when he was playing.  He was, at the time, an injury prone 30 year old CB.  I cannot think of a player Ted Thompson would have been ***less*** likely to give a ***7 year contract***.  Let me repeat, Ted Thompson wanted to sign a CB for ages 30-36.

What happened?  They basically converted Woodson what we now call the ""star"" position and he pumped out arguably 5 of the best seasons of his career over that 7 year contract including his only DPOY in 2009.  I mean, over the 7 seasons (really 6.5 as he missed half of his last year) he ***averaged*** generating 7.6 picks + FF per season including 11 in his first season and 13 the year he was DPOY.  JFC.  That doesn't even factor in that he was a ""force multiplier"" due to the fact that he was one of the smartest DBs in the league and led arguably the best secondary the Packers have ever fielded:  Woodson, Collins, Burnett, Shields and Harris.  

We did not appreciate what we had in 2010.  That 2011 team should have gone back-to-back and I will never understand how that team shit the bed so hard at home in the playoffs.  ***Four turnovers*** against the Giants and ***-3 on the game***.  What a waste... 15-1 and they do that in the first playoff game.

As contracts and guarantees have exploded, players are opting for shorter deals with higher guaranteed amounts. This allows them to re-enter the extension pool sooner and collect more guaranteed money. 

A seven year deal in 2006 is mainly going to be salary. The guaranteed money would've been substantially smaller, probably something like $10M-$20M, IF that. So it's more of a team option year to year. 

Guys used to sign big extensions and get cut a year or two in, it happened all the time. Lavar Arrington signed that same off-season to a 7/$49M deal and was cut a year later. 

Longer extensions used to the norm, and players got most of their money from their salaries. Now, shorter extensions are more the norm and players exclusively care about guaranteed amounts.",201875.0,neutral

Woodson last season with the raiders before he signed with the packers was a franchise deal.

Also J Love is great and a good decision maker, I just feel like we don’t know if he has that X factor in him. These next couple weeks will be very interesting to watch. What do you guys think? Yes. Definitely.

Favorites? Probably not at the moment. The first odds site I pulled up has the chiefs as the favorites at +500. The Packers are third at +750 behind, believe it or not, the Lions (+650).

There are a lot of ways to win a Super Bowl. I would argue that the most important factor is that you need consistently good-to-great play. There are plenty of teams each year who can beat the best on a good day, or lose to mediocre teams on a bad day. The Packers often fall into that category imo, and you aren’t likely to win the 4 (3 if bye) consecutive games necessary to win a Super Bowl.

This year’s Packers look like they could have that consistency. It’s really too early to say. Our loss to the Browns and our tie to the Cowboys provide evidence to the contrary, but consistently good-to-great play isn’t a necessary until we near the end of the season.

Another common factor for Super Bowl teams is great defense. Not necessarily required, but certainly a common thread across SB capable teams. The 2007 Giants were able to disrupt the Patriots’ explosive (and undefeated) offense in the Super Bowl by pressuring Brady without blitzing. There are plenty of differences between their D-Line in 2007 and ours this year, but I would argue that Parsons, Gary, Wyatt, and LVN provide plenty of similarities as well.

But they gotta stay/get healthy. This is another factor that plays heavily into the ultimate calculation of who comes out on top.

Speaking of Defense, it’s important to keep in mind that our only loss this year was from 13 points, 7 of which came from an interception Cleveland returned to the four-yard line. I’m much more concerned about their performance in the Cowboys game. They’ve been bend but don’t break all year, and I believe we currently sit in the top 10 (maybe top 5?) for DVOA. Again, stay/get healthy, and this is a factor that leans in favor of calling us a SB capable team.

Another big factor in Super Bowl wins is ball control. This is really two categories. First, simply consider giveaways and takeaways. More possessions with above average field position = more chances to score. We’re around mid-league in this stat at +1 (4 takeaways and 3 giveaways), but I would argue that one should also consider the implied volatility of high turnover rates. Put another way, our +1 is arguably a better indicator of Super Bowl capability than the Patriots +2, since theirs have come off of 11 takeaways vs 9 giveaways. More turnovers at the same differential is less likely to result in the consistent play required over a 4-game stretch in the playoffs.

Another ball control factor is time of possession. Long, sustained drives = time for your defense to rest. It also prevents high powered, explosive offenses (the type often seen in the Super Bowl) from having chances to score. We’re around mid-league in TOP, and a bit of improvement wouldn’t hurt when it comes to sustained drives. That said, our third down efficiency is second in the league. As a final point on ball control, our redzone efficiency is top 10, I believe.

Of course, defense and ball control aren’t the whole picture. They say that defenses win championships, but not without someone scoring points for their team, they don’t! Our EPA/play is second in the league to the colts, I think. The chiefs and the bills are in the same ballpark as us. So long as our offense continues to click, this factor weighs heavily in my opinion that we are “Super Bowl capable.”

Ultimately there is a long way to go before we know how we shape up in the league. We’ve got a hell of a gauntlet to fight through for the rest of the season. Five division games (three on the road), and all of those will be competitive in a year like this. Outside of the NFCN, we face the Eagles at home (6-2, currently #2 in the NFC behind us), the Broncos on the road (6-2, currently first in their division and 3rd overall in the AFC), and then only two games against teams in the bottom half of the NFC (Panthers (4-4) and Giants (2-6)) and one game against a bottom-half AFC team (Ravens 2-5). I’d say that’s seven very tough games and three that hopefully look like business as usual. Nothing will come easy.",261427.0,neutral

Our CB room gets really thin, really quickly after Nixon, CV, and Hobbs (people will clown on Hobbs but he's a good slot and he played well in Vegas, he's just playing less aggressive than he did over there for us for some reason. He's still a good 3rd option).

Clearly Asante Samuel isn't going to be expected to come in and start and fans thinking so should banish that thought from their minds but we just lost our developmental practice squad CB, Kamal Hadden has contributed 0 defensive snaps with only 5 on special teams this season and Bo Melton is primarily a special teamer.

Samuel played for passing game coordinator Derrick Ansley so if the interest is real it should be safe to assume Ansley gave a vote of confidence.

Hopefully Samuel is open to starting out on the practice squad while he gets up to speed and into football shape. The neck injury is the main concern but he also has never been a very physical player which is an issue when it comes to tackling and special teams so it could be tough to justify rostering both Samuel and Hadden if neither are going to contribute much on special teams.",10886.0,neutral

Multiple first rounders for Cutler, trading picks that ended up being Alvin Kamara and Fred Warner to move up when they likely could have had him with their original pick, Justin Fields, and now Caleb Williams, the most sought after QB since maybe Luck not performing well.  And that's just since Rodgers came into the league.  Just Brutal.

Would be a slam dunk mid season signing though. You’re probably not gonna find anything better mid season unless you can swing a big trade, which the Packers probably aren’t all that interested in given that they’re short on draft capital. Samuel might not be perfect, hell he could outright stink, but he’s the best shot at a legitimate fix at the position.

 I knew Parsons would get Gary going.  I’m betting they both exceed 10 sacks.  The bigger question is what do we do with LVN.  I thought he was going to have a monster year.  He has improved, but his production hasn’t really screamed “monster year” like Gary’s has.  He will be up for a contract year next year, so something will have to give, and we don’t have a first.

The incident wasn't in the initial broadcast angle, but it then showed Bullard in the middle, and I just assumed that he was the one who initiated it. Turns out, he got essentially tacked by the back of his helmet while blocking, and some dude took a cheap shot at Melton. Bullard was just standing up for a teammate to (seemingly) the whole Pittsburgh roster. 

It is refreshing that in this game, it seems that we weren't the ones making the bonehead moves by making things physical.

Anyone who says it was lucky throw is just a hater. To me, this is his signature ability.

When he sees a defender either with their back turned, or out of position even slightly he's not afraid to rip those throws.

It often looks super risky live time, but he's consistently hit that type of throw. He believes he can hit any throw on the field.

Anyone who says it was lucky throw is just a hater. Here's what I love about Love: he trusts all of his pass catchers to do their job, and he has confidence in himself to put the ball where they have a good chance.

Of course, they don't always come down with it (or it hits them right in the chest or hands and they forget how to clutch the ball), and he continues to have faith in them.


His receivers aren't afraid to make a mistake, just like Love. They have confidence in themselves *and* each other. 

That's actually how this entire team is coached. The defense talks about this aspect of Hafley's coaching all the time.

Anyone who says it was lucky throw is just a hater. I'll be looking forward to seeing a breakdown or analysis on this throw.  A lot of people seemed to be critical of it at the time or passed it off as  a lucky throw. To me it seems like an exceptional throw.  Love ultimately recognized the db underneath not in a position to make an easy play and threw a dart to Watson.  Even *if* the db was able to get back on it, Watson is in far superior positioning to potentially high point a conested catch. But he didnt need to, he just let it fall right into the bread basket because it was far over the reach of the db. Love needed to get the pass over the DB, and keep it in front of Watson so that the guy he beat wouldn't have a chance to recover and Love did both those things beautifully.",991356.0,positive

Whenever he makes a boneheaded move, which we all know he has, he does not often let that carry over into the next play and the next and the next. He very rarely does anything that resembles a complete meltdown or crumbling (see Dak Prescott in the 2023 season WC playoff game against us, or Caleb Williams in...well, you name it). Sure, we've seen Jordan get discouraged, but at the most it's for the duration of one game. Then he comes out shooting the following week and does some amazing things, even though he may not play like a HoFer. Consequently, and rightfully so, he is called inconsistent. 

But I have to ask this: when we have a new starting QB who is learning, experimenting, figuring out what went wrong and then doing better going forward between snaps, can we really be *that* upset about inconsistency? Sure, he sat behind the GOAT, Aaron Rodgers, for a couple of years. But watching from the sidelines is not the same as playing under those bright lights, leading the storied Green Bay Packers while tens of thousands of people are screaming their expectations and their vitriol and millions more are watching on live television. How spoiled are we by Favre and Rodgers (who, let's not forget, had their own learning curves)? 

Yes, this progression is just what one would expect from your franchise QB, but let's be serious. Look at some of the other young QBs in the league (CJ Stroud, et al.). The ability to take that path with grace and aplomb is not as common as we think. We need to maintain perspective, here.

Does Jordan Love have areas in which he needs improvement? One hundred percent. Sometimes he seems to make some questionable rookie reads, for example, although I wouldn't say he's alone in that. However, the ability that Love has to dust himself off after adversity/bad plays and move on with calculation, take frustration and channel it into improvement, on a play-by-play basis? That's special. That's what you want in your young, up-and-coming franchise QB. That's one of those intangibles that can't really be measured in stats, other than the steady upward trend over time. As we can see, the numbers don't lie, fellow cheeseheads.

We are seeing a marked improvement in his decision-making. He is taking care of the football in a way he didn't before. He is taking his risks still, but they are more calculated, and what's more, *they are paying off.* He is standing up for his guys and telling MLF, ""Hey, let me go for it on this 4th & whatever. I can do it. This offense can do it."" And to his credit, finally, MLF says, ""Okay."" 

*And then Jordan Love and the Green Bay Packers fucking do it.* 

He's confident without arrogance, he's unselfish, he lifts up his teammates, and he's always got his eyes set on how he can do better in the next moment. He knows that the most important play is always the next one. I think his journey to where he is, his unlikely success, has taught him that setbacks will happen, but with his talent and work ethic, he knows he can overcome. Jordan Love has ice in his veins, but, maybe more importantly, he also has fire in his heart. 

He embodies the spirit of the Green Bay Packers that I have come to know and love. So I will, unironically and without any reservations, say that Jordan Love is HIM. Jordan Love is the guy. Jordan Love is *our quarterback,* and we couldn't be more fortunate.

Sure, he sat behind the GOAT, Aaron Rodgers, for a couple of years. But watching from the sidelines is not the same as playing under those bright lights, leading the storied Green Bay Packers while tens of thousands of people are screaming their expectations and their vitriol and millions more are watching on live television. How spoiled are we by Favre and Rodgers (who, let's not forget, had their own learning curves)? 

Yes, this progression is just what one would expect from your franchise QB, but let's be serious. Look at some of the other young QBs in the league (CJ Stroud, et al.). The ability to take that path with grace and aplomb is not as common as we think. We need to maintain perspective, here.

Does Jordan Love have areas in which he needs improvement? One hundred percent. Sometimes he seems to make some questionable rookie reads, for example, although I wouldn't say he's alone in that. However, the ability that Love has to dust himself off after adversity/bad plays and move on with calculation, take frustration and channel it into improvement, on a play-by-play basis? That's special. That's what you want in your young, up-and-coming franchise QB. That's one of those intangibles that can't really be measured in stats, other than the steady upward trend over time. As we can see, the numbers don't lie, fellow cheeseheads.

We are seeing a marked improvement in his decision-making. He is taking care of the football in a way he didn't before. He is taking his risks still, but they are more calculated, and what's more, *they are paying off.* He is standing up for his guys and telling MLF, ""Hey, let me go for it on this 4th & whatever. I can do it. This offense can do it."" And to his credit, finally, MLF says, ""Okay."" 

*And then Jordan Love and the Green Bay Packers fucking do it.* 

He's confident without arrogance, he's unselfish, he lifts up his teammates, and he's always got his eyes set on how he can do better in the next moment. He knows that the most important play is always the next one. I think his journey to where he is, his unlikely success, has taught him that setbacks will happen, but with his talent and work ethic, he knows he can overcome. Jordan Love has ice in his veins, but, maybe more importantly, he also has fire in his heart. 

He embodies the spirit of the Green Bay Packers that I have come to know and love. So I will, unironically and without any reservations, say that Jordan Love is HIM. Jordan Love is the guy. Jordan Love is *our quarterback,* and we couldn't be more fortunate.

1ohk6o5,1761611129.0,298,0.97,54,Fandom,"The ""Inconsistency"" of Jordan Love: An Unabashed Hype Post One of the best things about Jordan Love is that he doesn't look back. During his first season as a starter in 2023, I could not have been more impressed with how cool under pressure he was.

Whenever he makes a boneheaded move, which we all know he has, he does not often let that carry over into the next play and the next and the next. He very rarely does anything that resembles a complete meltdown or crumbling (see Dak Prescott in the 2023 season WC playoff game against us, or Caleb Williams in...well, you name it). Sure, we've seen Jordan get discouraged, but at the most it's for the duration of one game. Then he comes out shooting the following week and does some amazing things, even though he may not play like a HoFer. Consequently, and rightfully so, he is called inconsistent.

So when the Packers decided to get a safety net when a projected #1 or 2 QB fell to them in the 20s, they took him not knowing what was going to happen with Brett. Brett for some reason had a chip with Rodgers though he had nothing to do with the situation. He continued his dance until GB was finally tired of it and said, ""enjoy NY"". Yeah he got his 2 years with Minnesota but nothing really happened other than getting to beat the Packers.

While Rodgers had his own issues, he didn't have any with Love. He realized that Love was drafted and had no say in it. He knew Love would work hard but the job was Rodgers to lose. I think Rodgers got frustrated more with front office not GM-ing the way he would. Gets to NY, does a little GM work, doesn't really work. Realizes what a bad culture can do. Decides he wants to go to a place that has a good culture but his options are limited. Ends up in Pittsburgh and the team gets him weapons that the team already knew they needed. Love goes on to do his thing in GB and seeing his relationship with Clifford and Willis shows he is a good guy who knows at any moment it could all be over. Enjoy the game, appreciate your teammates, and ball out.

What I did like was that Love said, ""I'm gonna need that"". Clearly wanting to have #8 Steelers jersey on his wall of fame. And Rodgers nice response of ""I'll send it over"".",3764202.0,positive

Props to Quay! Yo, great callout! I was thinking in the moment, what a huge asset in this game if you can get these guys on tilt and fighting you. When you're the ones employing words or trash talk, or whatever's going on, but can hold up your self-control and stop short of retaliation, that's a winning combo. Shut down that drive with the penalty backing them up, iirc. 

I hope someone plays this back for Quay and shows him how big and good he looked in that moment staying composed, and even in contrast to a vet like DK who should be able to handle himself better than that. (and in contrast to Quay's previous hissy-fit moments when he looked like a big baby-man out of control out there, and costing his team on completely unforced errors... sorry, not sorry - all of it to say, great to see how far Quay has come;)

Props to Quay! DK looked like he was trying to make his case to a coach or someone on the sidelines... I wonder what Quay did or said that he really thought he had an argument there.

I wonder if Quay maybe had poked DK in the eye or neck or something the course of a play previously (purposely or not...) and then what we saw was him verbally prodding him about it after? 

It's a rough sport - I notice all sorts of nasty looking stuff happen on tackles that's just considered normal and acceptable, it seems. Feels like I've seen a lot more neck grabbing in the course of tackles lately - one last night where a guy threw JLove down by the neck. Thinking back to the JReed injury tackle, too, that guy had a lock on Jayden's neck throughout that tackle and landing iirc. Maybe recalling one on CWatson last night, too.

Go Pack Go! I think we are seeing an MLF who is assessing his own performance better than years past. Cautious playcalling leading to a tie in Dallas? The next week he’s going for it on 4th down because Jordan wants to. This week, can’t get Jacobs going.

Go Pack Go! He's essentially a victim of his own high standards. Youngest roster in the league 2 years running and if we're anything other than unbeaten people are calling for his head.

On paper, a team on the other side of a hall-of-fame quarterback dynasty which included a ring and several near misses, which is now (at least by average age) very much in the rebuild portion of its cycle, should be delighted to be even scraping into the playoffs, with a view to progressing over a longer time-frame as bits get added.

Don't forget that MLF rebuilt the scheme and had input into getting the pieces in place to make it work. The front office have done a phenomenal job, in this regard, as well.

In one of the most competitive industries in the world, with one of the smallest talent pools and hampered by a salary cap it's simply not possible to have the absolute #1 candidate by ability in every single role we've got to fill; Matty has done an incredible job of weaving all of those sub-optimal pieces into one of the finest complete pictures in the game and its testament to his skill as a leader.

It's easy to hypothesise about how much better we'd be with [the maximum potential of] person X in place of [the actual production of] person Y but its nigh-on-impossible to functionally deliver the fantasy. MLF excels of getting almost every drop of juice out of what's in front of him and that makes him one of the best coaches in the game right now - even if we inevitably fall short.

It would be dull of everybody robotically pretended things were always perfect when they're not, but the man deserves his flowers and our backing. He's already built something special, imo - time and the history book might one day record empirically just how special it is. And we get to tag along for the ride.

Even though he might never reach the kind of numbers you hope for in a WR1, the offense just flows differently when he's out there. Easily the most impactful WR beyond the standard metrics, between stretching defenses and blocking on the edge.

Aussie here with little actual knowledge of the technical aspects of the game…but I love watching it now our NRL season is over and I’m a big Packers supporter. 
A few striking observations for me that I believe apply here and broadly across every team sport. 
Firstly, the acquisition of Micah Parsons was a brilliant move. Obviously he’s elite at his position but more than that his attitude and approach appear to be completely team vice individual performance focused. Every interview I’ve seen from him shows a thoughtful, modest and intelligent man who puts the team ahead of himself. He’s very vocal about wanting to elevate the performance of those around him and the results are plain to see. His influence on the team can’t be overstated. 
Secondly, Jordan Love has developed well and is likely “on schedule” for a player with his natural talent. He played out of his skin as the statistics show but for me the highlight was how calm he looked out there. To me he looked really comfortable and the lack of any histrionics when things went wrong was indicative of a great mindset and the knowledge that it was a temporary setback that wasn’t going to derail the game plan. As per Micah he displays a team first attitude. 
Thirdly, Tucker Kraft is in a purple patch and seems to have the same attitude. His post contact game is impressive which I think is due to his incredible balance for such a big body. Jordan has demonstrated his complete trust in Tucker and he looks to be the go-to guy when things get tight. This could develop into a hugely important relationship as the season progresses and beyond. 
Lastly, the coaching staff have galvanised the group and developed a great culture. It seems blindingly obvious that this is a priority but in a team of individuals with different personalities and motivations is often difficult if not impossible to achieve. Post game footage I’ve seen shows they are united and committed to the plan, the goals and most importantly each other. The emotion Josh Jacobs showed after the Cardinals game demonstrated this. 

It’s a long season and there will be bumps in the road but I think there’s a lot to look forward to.",2622861.0,positive

At the game level, it really is a roller coaster. He’s just not aesthetically pleasing on his deep balls. Those floaters that just seem to work out are terrifying. I appreciate his willingness to attack on those medium range middle of the field shots, something that Rodgers largely abandoned throwing post Super Bowl.

Sometimes I feel like people forget about the Favre years and how absolute nut case all over the place it was. Love is this bizarre combination of Favre, Rodgers, and has this odd war mode mentality of Brees when trotting out there. Not the same zip on the ball like Brees, but maybe I am crazy. The offense doesn’t move like a war machine like with Brees under center, but there is just something about his presence at times that reminds me of it.",15020628.0,negative

Any doubters of 10, all I ask is where are you hiding now? I’m not going to say anything one way or another.  Mainly, because I don’t like saying stuff like that, especially mid-season.  I will say that was his best game so far as a Packer.  He looked elite.  He was playing lights out.  He had a helluva game!  MLF apparently uncorked his head at halftime too, or it was Love making audibles and changing plays that got us to the promised land.  

I took a shower at half time expecting to come back to a slaughter.  I’m glad the defense finally started showing up as well.  They didn’t play terrible that first half (minus Nixon), but they didn’t play great either.  It was nice to see they started really putting pressure on them and Our linebackers played very well.  Valentine played well too.  Wilson gave Love the other punch we needed, and he opened up things for Love and the offense.   

Awesome game by Love, and I look forward to more of that this season.  It was also nice to see Rodgers play well too.  Sure, it wasn’t his best game, but he still played well.  His offense just didn’t give him too much with drops and everything else.  Great game by both the mentor and mentee.",1299862.0,negative

Any doubters of 10, all I ask is where are you hiding now? Honest answer:

When he carries the team. When he wills the team to victory in tough, close games.  When the game is on the line and you want the ball in his hands -and you trust he can and will win it.  When he makes throws that 'wow' you. When he makes throws no other/few QBs are making.  When he does these things consistently for seasons at a time.  And when he wins big games. Superbowls.

I say this as a Jordan Love fan myself.  But he's not flashy.  He rarely ""wows"".  He's just steady, consistent, and good.  He doesn't make a lot of bonehead plays. He finds the open man.  He doesn't have a cocky/social media driven image.  All are great for us, but it's not hard to understand how that doesn't grab the attention of the ""world"" and yell ""elite!"".

I don't need the world to consider him elite. I just need him to do what he does and win games.  Then the world can consider the Packers 'Elite' and  that'll be good enough for me. :)

-All joking aside, the Pack likely still wouldn't be considered 'elite"" by many if they just played the way they have been but won the SB this year.  Why? Still a lack of media-friendly ""Superstars"" Most don't consider Jacobs elite. None of our WR are 'elite'.  And aside from Parsons, no one on the Defense is either.  They're just not household names.  Sure, some of that can change.  And we all hope it does.  But for now, it is what it is.

I find it makes it even easier to root for them - and presumably easier for other teams to underestimate them. 

They are underdogs (as individuals). They're the smallest market team. They are guys who go out there and win, without making the headlines between games.",433287.0,positive

1ogyc60,1761534056.0,4500,0.99,104,News,"The field looks awful for tonight’s game  Acrisure Stadium uses Desso GrassMaster, a hybrid system where real grass is grown into a synthetic carpet stitched 8 inches deep with artificial fibers. The idea is solid: the fibers add stability and help the grass hold together under stress, while still giving players the feel and safety benefits of natural turf.

But in Pittsburgh, this system fails hard because of overuse and zero recovery time.

They play over 25 games a year on it—Steelers home games, Pitt Panthers home games, and WPIAL high school playoffs—often on back-to-back days. That’s like running a marathon and then sprinting again before your legs stop shaking.

Natural grass needs time to root deeply into the soil to stay intact. In a hybrid system, the artificial backing helps, but only if the live grass above it stays healthy and dense. When it’s constantly torn up, the grass thins out, dies in patches, and never re-establishes.

Once the top layer is worn away, cleats hit the drainage base directly—a thick layer of sand and fine gravel designed to prevent flooding. That’s what you see exploding upward every time a player plants or cuts: pure sand from the sub-base, not infill like on artificial turf. It’s the field literally disintegrating under pressure.

They resod the entire field multiple times per season, sometimes right after a Steelers game. But when Pitt plays the next day, the new sod—barely rooted—gets shredded immediately. It’s a cycle of damage and patch-up with no real fix.

Cooler fall temperatures slow grass growth, and dry conditions this year made it worse. The hybrid system works great in places with lighter schedules (like some European soccer stadiums), but here, it’s overmatched.

Bottom line: Desso GrassMaster is a good concept ruined by an impossible schedule. The grass can’t survive, the base gets exposed, and you end up with a patchy, dusty, dangerous mess that looks like a construction site mid-game.",467775.0,neutral

——

GREEN BAY, Wis. — Not that there was any doubt, but Aaron Rodgers told Green Bay Packers reporters Thursday that he will retire with the team that drafted him when he closes his career.

Rodgers, speaking on a Zoom call ahead of the Packers’ matchup with his Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday night, will one day have his No. 12 on the Lambeau Field facade as the seventh number retired in Packers history.

“I was there for 18 years,” Rodgers said. “Regardless of when I hang it up, that’s the bulk of my career. I’ll retire a Packer and see what happens after that. I’ve got a lot of love for the organization, my time there. They asked this week, ‘Is it a revenge game?’ or whatever. What do I got to be avenging here? They made me a ton of money. I grew up there, spent some of the best years of my life there. I’ve got nothing but love for the organization.

“Damn near everything great in my life is because of my football career, and my football career starts and will end one day with Green Bay. So I’ve got a lot of love for all those memories and a lot of great friends I still carry with me to this day.”

Rodgers told “The Pat McAfee Show” this summer that he’s “pretty sure” 2025 will be his final season in the NFL. If Rodgers retires after this season, that would likely send him into the Packers Hall of Fame four years later and the Pro Football Hall of Fame five years later, both on the first ballot. Rodgers must be in the Pro Football Hall of Fame before the Packers retire his number, though nobody has worn No. 12 since they traded him in 2023, and nobody will before it’s officially engraved next to Brett Favre’s No. 4.

The 41-year-old Rodgers is the league’s oldest player in his 21st season, but still more than capable of slinging the rock. He showcased as much in last Thursday night’s shootout against the Cincinnati Bengals, and has thrown 14 touchdowns to five interceptions through six games this season.

“The s— look the same,” said Packers cornerback Keisean Nixon, Rodgers’ teammate in 2022. “It’s his arm. It’s not really nothing else, just brain and arm, so he ain’t losing that.”

While Rodgers’ allegiance will lie with the Steelers (4-2) on Sunday night in Pittsburgh against the Packers (4-1-1), his desire to make his former team the 32nd one he’s defeated doesn’t detract from the memories he made in Green Bay.

Rodgers took a trip down memory lane Thursday on Zoom, from riding a custom golf cart across South Oneida Street to practice with former Packers left tackle David Bakhtiari, former Packers head coach Mike McCarthy putting an end to road-trip pranks by former Packers Matt Flynn, Graham Harrell, T.J. Lang and Josh Sitton because they were too crazy, throwing blankets and pillows at sleeping teammates on planes and more.

“We were always messing around, having a good time,” Rodgers said. “Those were some of the most fun … going way back, we had a crazy crew.”

There are 13 players still on the Packers who played at least a season with Rodgers, who last played for the team in 2022, but Rodgers had one at the top of his list when asked for his jersey swap preference after Sunday night’s game.

“It’d probably be Jordan (Love),” Rodgers said of the quarterback he mentored for three seasons before Love took over as Green Bay’s starter.

Love said this week that Sunday’s matchup is just another game, that he’s facing the Steelers defense and Rodgers is facing the Packers defense. Rodgers, however, was a bit more honest about what Sunday night will really mean.

“It’s one of 17, for sure. Obviously, the 18 years I played there, it’s a little more special than the other ones,” Rodgers said. “When I saw the NFC North was on the schedule and the Jets were on the schedule, that was pretty cool to be able to play all those teams. I said it a while ago, but this one would mean a lot more if it was in Lambeau just because of the affection I have for that place and that hallowed ground of Lambeau Field and all the amazing memories that I have there over the years.

“Most of the guys that have reached out this week and that I know really well are not on the team. It’s the training staff, it’s Adam (Korzun) in nutrition and Evan (Siegle) the photographer and those guys. So I’m excited to see those guys, especially. Obviously excited to see J-Love and Keisean and some of the guys I was with — Rome (Doubs) and Christian (Watson) — but I’m really excited to see all those guys and, hopefully, they’ll get out early so I can give them some love and catch up.”",1168881.0,
