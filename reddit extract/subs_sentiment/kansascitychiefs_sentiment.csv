But those frogs should be getting a little warmer in the pot. A lot of changes CAN be made elsewhere, though. Matt Nagy can kick rocks. Veach has invested far too much in the offense for it to look like the 2017 team: talented, but undisciplined, plays are too slow, the run game is inexplicably abandoned, and it runs into a wall against a good defense or when the game actually matters. I don't care who calls what, or who throws to who. There is no longer any justification for Matt Nagy at OC. You can put Dave Toub, Connor Embree, and Andy Heck on notice too after this game. Jawaan Taylor has an option for the next offseason. It should be everyone for themselves on the roster. The rot is setting in, and the tree needs to be pruned.

1oz2v38,1763341761.0,156,0.82,123,DISCUSSION,"I'm tired boss. Quick story. After the Christmas game against the Raiders, I said that if this team makes the Super Bowl, someone has converted to Satanism. The more I watch this team this year, the more I wonder if that theory holds water and this is the demon coming to collect. 

You let the biggest frauds in the NFL dunk on us in the 4th quarter and you had zero offensive answer when you had a chance to end the football game. You've kissed the division goodbye, and with Jacksonville beating LA, you might aswell kiss the Wildcard goodbye too because this is pathetic, uninspired, sloppy, and anemic football. Where do I start?

\-Barely any pressure. And when you have some, you don't finish. 

\-You constantly give up 3rd and long in pivotal situations.

  
\-The offense looks lackadaisical. The run game doesn't exist. Recievers have decided to not catch the ball. The offensive line loves to collapse or give up drive altering penalties at the worst possible moment. It is nearly impossible to be this unclutch. ​

  
\-You have a chance to put the game away, given a gift up by a score, and you don't even get past the 35. 

  
This is legitimately bad football. I've seen worse out of this team, most certainly. But that was back when we weren't consistently fighting for the division and just trying to make it out of the cellar. There is no doomerism. We are just bad. Bad. BAD. 

And you know what? ​I am a masochist and I will still tune in next week to watch Jonathon Taylor kick our faces in because we have just decided that playing good football this year just isn't worth it. 

If we don't make the playoffs or something doesn't galvanize this team like that Christmas Day incident, then we honestly need to consider cleaning house on the coaching staff because something stinks and it is spreading. ",15862.0,negative

1oz2d9t,1763340423.0,833,0.91,383,DISCUSSION,"KC deserves to miss the playoffs this year. I know it’s popular to flame the coaches this year, but this team has a ton of offensive talent and there’s just obscene lapses at times. You can’t blame the play-calling for Mahomes missing Tyquan or Worthy down the field on the first drive. You can’t blame Rice’s two drops on play calling. You can’t blame Taylor’s drive-killing penalties on play calling. These are horrid mental lapses. This is the second game in a row where the team looked like they didn’t even want to be there. Many of these players have 1-3 Super Bowl rings. I think a lot of them have bought into their own hype and have become fat (proverbially) and happy, so there’s a lot of half-assing it in games. Perhaps missing the playoffs would be a needed wake up call; it would also position them better in the draft to maybe grab an edge rusher worthwhile to position opposite of Karlaftis.

Kehoe, who has been in regular discussions with Chiefs executives, said there has been no talk of building a traditional domed stadium in Missouri. But that doesn’t mean there couldn’t be another type of covering over the Chiefs’ well-known home.

“There’s some interesting architectural improvements to make to Arrowhead that could be conducive to an all-weather protective environment without being a full dome,” Kehoe told The Associated Press on Tuesday. “I would say, look at some of the structures that are in Europe that may have some sort of fabric device that goes over it.”

Such a covering for Arrowhead is no sure thing, Kehoe said, but it could be one way to preserve its famous outdoor environment while still providing an indoor-like option that’s often preferred for major events, such as a Super Bowl.

The Chiefs declined to address Kehoe’s latest thoughts when reached by AP on Tuesday, referring instead to comments made by chairman Clark Hunt to local reporters before the team played the Washington Commanders a few weeks ago. At the time, Hunt said the club founded by his late father, Lamar Hunt, was still considering options on both sides of the Kansas-Missouri state line.

“I wouldn’t say we’re in limbo. Stadium projects move at their own pace,” Hunt said. “We’ve learned over the years that you can’t really force them to go faster, even if you want them to. And so it’s just important for us to keep working on both options.”",9936.0,neutral

I am just hearing the news of the death of Marshawn Kneeland, the Cowboys second year defensive end who died of an apparent suicide. What an absolute tragedy. I am saddened to think about his family and teammates missing him. 

Things like this always serve to remind us to check on our people and take care of ourselves. You never know what people are going through and the only way we can help is if we ask them, directly. Check on your people today and always. If you need help, use the hotline above, reach out to a friend of family, or hell, even reach out to someone in the Red Kingdom. 

It also reminds me about the visibility and connectedness and lack of privacy that defines our world today. Players lives are put on blast 24/7 and their privacy is compromised. Their personal worth is equated to the on-the-field performance. We can be fans and still respect that privacy, say, when a player is gone for a month for undisclosed reasons. We don’t know what they’re going through, and while it’s natural to be curious, I think today reminds me that these people live incredibly public lives that many of us cannot comprehend. With the internet, we don’t know how our comments might hit one of these players or someone else, especially in a vulnerable time.

This type of situation reminds me of something I heard Kelce say in his podcast maybe a year ago: be a fountain, not a drain…. Lift people up, don’t bring them down…. and seeing as how KC is the City of Fountains, and the city that made me who I am, it’s always stuck with me in life.

A) Blatantly false click bait with misinformation. Quite literally fake articles with fake news.

B) Supposed screenshots of private pages of Josh's family. I've neither tried to verify or disprove those, but sufficed to say, this is not the community to be posting TMZ style leaks of people's private information. Especially when it seems clear Josh and the team don't want to publicize.

Moving forward. Blatant misinformation will be met with temp to permanent bans. Of course sources can be wrong, but please do a basic level of fact checking. We aren't sticklers as long a **good faith** is made.

We will also be **enforcing our rules around reposts and repetitive topics**. New information, from verified sources such as the team are always allowed.

We all agreed that 15 should be retired once Mahomes hangs it up, but I also said that 87 should be retired, to which we disagreed. They said that since we didn't retire Tony G's number, Kelce doesn't deserve to have his retired. I thought this was dumb. Tony G was excellent, but I firmly believe that Kelce is probably the best TE we have ever had. Similarly to Tony G, he has also broken several records and he's still playing dangerously despite being 36 years old. That's not mentioning the super bowls too. Sure, SBs are a team stat, but we can't act like Kelce wasn't a monumental reason as to why we won all of them. In the first SB against the Eagles, he caught a TD and had six catches for 81 yards (he was also our leading ""receiver"" during that season). Furthermore, I'll never forget the insane plays he had in the rematch against the Niners - that crazy catch on 3rd down to put us in chip shot FG range to send it to OT, and the play right before Hardman's game winner where bro fought for the first down with sheer fucking willpower.

>Kansas City Chiefs receiver Xavier Worthy stood in front of his locker after Sunday night’s 30-17 home win over the Detroit Lions, ready to talk about what was going right with his team’s offense.

>“It’s just an ‘Everybody eats’ offense,” Worthy said with a smile. “Everybody’s gonna get their turn.”

>Just behind him, while packing up his things, receiver Tyquan Thornton overheard Worthy talking and spoke up — loud enough so the microphones could hear him.

>“EGE!” Thornton yelled.

>The reference was to the Chiefs’ receivers room mantra this season: “Everybody’s gotta eat.” The gesture was also the perfect encapsulation of the chemistry this Chiefs receivers room currently possesses.

>Worthy was getting some of the spotlight after catching a touchdown against the Lions. And he was getting support in that moment from Thornton, someone who’d starred in earlier games but had just finished one with 17 snaps and no catches.

>It didn’t matter. The Chiefs had won, and Thornton — genuinely — was happy for his buddy.

>“We’re just like brothers, for real,” Chiefs receiver Hollywood Brown said Thursday. “It’s fun being a part of a group with such great open communication.”

>The band sticking together will only become more critical as top receiver Rashee Rice returns to the lineup Sunday after his six-game NFL suspension. Reid has talked often this week about how there’s only one football to go around. The Chiefs will have fewer touches for other playmakers with Rice coming back, and others in the pecking order could see their playing time decrease.

>That’s where their friendship could become important. Chiefs pass game coordinator Joe Bleymaier says one helpful aspect is that each receiver seems to have genuine respect and admiration for the guys around them.
Instead of jealousy or rivalry among teammates, then, it’s led to something else.

>“Everybody’s gotta eat” will get its biggest test soon. The Chiefs’ receivers will need to remain positive and encouraging, even with more mouths to feed.",3742.0,positive

Now, every week, it’s “the Chiefs are cheating,” “the refs love Mahomes,” “their fans are obnoxious,” “the NFL is rigged for them.”

That’s not hate. That’s *fear.*

When a team starts winning year after year, when your QB becomes the standard everyone else measures against, when your coach is a legend and your games are *the* ones everyone tunes in for — people can’t help but look for excuses. It’s what every fan base does when they realize they’re watching a dynasty unfold and their team’s not part of it.

So let them talk. Let them boo. Let them call us lucky, rigged, annoying — whatever helps them sleep at night. We’ll just keep stacking wins, collecting rings, and filling Arrowhead with noise.

1nweyc2,1759436769.0,209,0.88,173,DISCUSSION,"Veach Trade Deadline most likely targets It’s no secret how awful the RB run game has been, the RB’s have the second fewest runs of 10 or more yards in the NFL and dead last in games with a RB exceeding 50 yards with the best performance being Pacheco with 45 against the Giants worst run defense in the NFL, if Veach pursues a trade at the deadline like he’s made a habit of doing the last 3-4 years, for the first time the WR position is not a need, it is the RB position and there are two options Veach should pursue. 

The first is Breece Hall stuck on an (0-4) Jets team who is second in the NFL in explosive runs of 10 or more yards, he would add dynamism that would make the offense fully healthy virtually impossible to stop, I’d start off a trade discussion with offering Isiah Pacheco and a 3rd rounder and see where the Jets take it. 

The second but more likely option is veteran Alvin Kamara who has produced 305 yards of offense on a garbage (0-4) Saints team but unlike Breece, Kamara is 30 so he’d feel more like a temporary rental for the rest of season with Veach not liking to spend heavily on players 30 or older especially RB’s so he’d go into next draft needing to spend a 1st or 2nd rounder on a RB, I’d offer Isiah Pacheco and a 4th or 5th and see where the Saints take it. 

If Veach is going to make a deadline trade it has to be for the RB position and these two make the most realistic sense, Damian Williams has the most 100 rushing yard games of the Mahomes era and he hasn’t played since SB54, that needs to change. ",32002.0,neutral

Are the Chiefs better or worse than expected through four games?

Worse, though things are trending upward.

Most disappointing is the 2-2 record, though K.C. has faced a difficult schedule. The Chiefs added to the degree of difficulty for this season by losing the opener to the Chargers — which puts their streak of nine consecutive AFC West titles at greater risk.

There’s also this: The Buffalo Bills are undefeated and have a light schedule ahead. They seem to be the overwhelming favorite to land the AFC’s 1 seed, which would make a K.C. playoff path more difficult.

>Team MVP: Patrick Mahomes
No surprise here; Mahomes has been the team’s top player. Early on, he started scrambling more often while the Chiefs were down their top two receivers. He also implored teammates to hold him accountable this offseason as he looked to make real change to push the ball downfield more often. The result has been a noticeable improvement in the passing game, thanks in part to the emergence of receiver Tyquan Thornton.

>Breakout player: Tyquan Thornton
The 2022 second-round pick developed quick chemistry with Mahomes after joining K.C.’s practice squad late last season, and the Chiefs now have to find ways to get him on the field in light of Worthy’s return. Thornton’s rise from the practice squad to roster hopeful to temporary WR1 has been the team’s best individual story of the early going.

>Top rookie: Josh Simmons
Simmons hasn’t been perfect. He doesn’t use his hands as much as he could with pass protection. And his run-blocking remains inconsistent for now. Taking all that into account, he has performed at the level of a roughly average NFL left tackle so far. And that’s a massive upgrade over anything the Chiefs have had there the last several seasons.

>Key player who needs to improve: Charles Omenihu
The Chiefs’ pass rush, as a whole, started slow in 2025, but better days could be ahead. Karlaftis has put together two strong games in a row, and Norman-Lott — still getting to full strength from a training-camp ankle injury — should only improve from here next to All-Pro Chris Jones on the inside. If Omenihu provides the type of threat he did against the Ravens, though, the entire unit’s outlook changes.


>Best development: Chiefs improving secondary 
The combination of coordinator Steve Spagnuolo and defensive backs coach Dave Merritt continues to produce secondary magic for K.C., as the team has consistently churned out production, regardless of who occupies those back-end spots.",1634.0,negative

1nuj7ar,1759252734.0,134,0.93,32,DISCUSSION,"Where the offense goes from here, the next evolution not enough people see 🤫 Every one is now focused, salivating on the return of Rashee Rice to finally see Rice, Worthy, & Hollywood play their first games all together + with emergence of Tyquan Thornton and ole trusted reliable vet JuJu, and while that will take the offense to another level, I don’t think that’s still the final plan/evolution of the offense returning to greatness!! 

The final evolution to this offense returning to glory is the pass catching RB role left behind by Jerick McKinnon that’s been a massive but quiet void people had not seriously keyed in on the absence of in 2023-24 & 2024-25, Pacheco is not a pass catching back and Kareem just does not have the burst to be a real threat other than a 3rd or 4th and short chain mover. That’s where Brashard Smith comes in, his snap count doubled to 20 this past game, eating into Pacheco’s. Smith has legitimate speed & route running to be a threat out of the back field taking short catches from screens, flat routes, drags, in or out breaking routes for big gains and be the new McKinnon so expect to see continued gradual increase of snaps for Brashard eating into Pacheco’s playing time and being a big factor by late season, I have Brashard stashed on my fantasy bench ready to use at least as a FLEX when he breaks out late November/December and you should seriously consider that as well when the time comes.

They mixed up their formations calling 20% under center plays with a 6th offensive lineman out of 70 total plays, that equates to 14 under center calls that were handoffs, bootlegs, end around toss to Worthy. This will always be a shotgun oriented offense but 20% target of under center snaps would be my goal every game if not more and more cause the best RB runs come from under center and defense gets caught off guard when Mahomes turns his back and fakes the handoff since it’s very rare for them to see under center looks so even more under center would be more beneficial cause we still need the RB run game to get more consistently involved and flowing cause can’t rely on Mahomes or Worthy being the leading rushers.

1nqb2b3,1758816925.0,238,0.97,70,ANALYSIS & NEWS,"Patrick Mahomes vowed to make a change. He’s been a different QB since. [Non-Paywall](https://archive.is/7SooO)

>Mahomes isn’t just delivering more throws downfield — he’s turned into one of the NFL’s most aggressive quarterbacks when it comes to launching the ball deep.
TruMedia’s data shows a drastic shift from years past. That’s especially the case on 20-plus yard throws; after attempting just 50 of those last season, Mahomes has 15 through the first three games of 2025.
The number of deep completions, meanwhile, is up as well.

>“I’m just excited for where this offense is going,” Mahomes said. “I know it hasn’t been the perfect product that we’ve put out there so far, but there’s a lot of good, too.”
Specifically, Mahomes has started to develop chemistry with speedy receiver Tyquan Thornton, who’s been targeted most often on the team’s deep shots. That included a critical play in Sunday’s 22-9 victory over the New York Giants, as Thornton pulled down a jump-ball catch for 33 yards on a third-and-10 late.

>“I think it just gives me the confidence, when guys like Tyquan come down with the catch that he did, that I can keep forcing the ball down the field and let them try to make plays,” Mahomes said. “We’ll continue to get better and better at that.”
For now, it’s at least giving defenses something more to think about.
The Chiefs offense, suddenly, has made an abrupt shift from dink-and-dunk to chuck-and-duck. And that shows up most drastically in Mahomes’ air-yard-per-attempt numbers — an advanced stat that had been in decline each season of his career.
Until this one, that is. 

>Even with this year’s long-throw improvement, Mahomes says the Chiefs can be better. Those one or two successful shots per game, he believes, could easily be three or four. Then maybe five or six after that.
For now, though, Mahomes sees reason to be optimistic about the direction of the Chiefs offense.
Especially because the deep bomb is back in the team’s arsenal.
“We’ll continue to get better and better at that, as well as with the rest of the offense,” Mahomes said. “But it’s always super-exciting when you get a chance to throw the ball down the field.”",16391.0,positive

[Story by Nate Taylor](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/47050784/travis-kelce-not-deciding-chiefs-return-season) It's going to be very interesting to see what Veach does if they don't make the playoffs. Does he just bring the same band back one more year? Does he use void years on a non mahomes contract for the first time?

Travis has been fantastic, but the idea was to send him off at the end of the year and we know that Veach does not love older players. It's 10 mill enough for Travis to come back? 

The Chiefs are -42 on the cap next year, and they can cut Jawaan and get 20, Danna and get 9, and Tranquill getting 6. Mahomes restructure and get 44 (or maybe he gets a new reworked deal? I thought this was the goal for the 2027 season, not this one). A restructure of Creed can get 8. Do they cut Gray? If Kelce is back, 7 mill cap hit for a TE2 seems like a lot when he's giving you 200 yards of production. Do they pay Rice and McDuffie?

I'm assuming Jones contract won't get touched to have a chance to get out of it at the end of the 2026 season, but if you really want to improve the team, you may have to sacrifice 2027 season and rework it. 45 mill cap hit is just a very tough pill to swallow.

We run a slow, plodding offense that runs the play clock down to nothing whether we are winning or losing that shrinks the game down.  Which worked great when the defense could get a stop, but is pretty much just losing us games now as we try to rely on it in the 4th quarter to win games and it's failed every time this year.

Also, I'm tired of people talking about the 1 score games like they're the same as last year.

This year we've been losing/tied in the 4th in 4/5 losses, and the other team finished the game out in all of them.

Little over 28 pts, a game average on offense, and a little over 13 points a game allowed at home vs. a little over 23 points scored per away games and a little over 24 points allowed on defense.

The Chiefs have like 41 or 42 away penalties, and like 28 home penalties.

Mahomes is like a 113 QB rating at home and a 84 or 85 on the road.

One-leg Mahomes winning a SB and a then a shot at a three-peat!! That would’ve been the only highlight of most any other franchise, and we got so much more!! 

I’m just disappointed because this team is so talented.  Kansas City is the only team beating Kansas City with silly penalties.  

Maybe, it’s the fact that many teams have been watching the Chiefs play and have learned their tendencies.   During last year’s SB the Eagles mentioned that to beat the Chiefs, you just have to keep playing as if there were two offensive plays on every down.   That’s how teams are preparing now.  Pat’s second effort is almost expected now and it doesn’t look like there has been adjustment.

I’ve lost track how many penalties and silly mistakes special teams have made.  Then, you have unnecessary holds or false starts and basic things like lining up correctly.

When teams like the Cowboys, Bears, and Cleveland get those type of flags people call out the lack of discipline and how it falls on the coaches.  The Chiefs have earned the benefit of the doubt, but, at some point, they need to realize the emperor has no clothes.

They look great when they are hitting on all cylinders, but seem to have lost that resilience.  When the team is down, that sideline looks so quiet and resigned.   I understand that any little thing is going to be magnified, but at some point you just need to treat it like it is a game in the backyard.

At the same time, I don’t really know crap about what these guys go through or their preparation. I don’t earn millions of dollars for being an expert at the top of my field like these guys.

 Leaving aside your garden variety doomer - We haven't changed up our offensive or defensive scheme in any real meaningful way and the rest of the league has not only caught up to us, but gone past us.  If it seems like opposing teams can accurately predict what we're going to do, it's because they've had YEARS of film showing what Reid is going to do in any given situation.

This team must adapt and change to a very different NFL landscape than the one that existed when Mahomes shot to the forefront 7 years ago.  The team is older, the schemes are even older, and the competition shows none of the complacency we seem to show on the field minus a few standouts.

I've been here for the bad, BAD years, the ""we coulda"" years, you name it.  We are in a rut. \*Something\* has to change, and while I'm not barking for Reid's retirement, this team has shown over and over again that change has to start at the top.

 Most people don't understand how NFL is or works. It's a self leveling system making sure no one team can stay on top for too long. Even the Patriots had a whole decade without a SB win and several down years. We already have 5 SB appearances and 3 wins. How much more can you get without tier one receiving core and no serious rushing game. 


There are salary caps that prevent teams from netting up all the good players. When you are on the top every other team is going to spend extra effort to make sure you lose. That's their Superbowl beating the Chiefs. Once a year.

 Just look at the team and the body language. They are unmotivated, unprepared, tired, undisciplined and just plain not having fun. This is two years now of this and those are all coaching issues.

 It is so insane. I’m not saying Andy is immune to criticism, but he’s pretty immune to being fired lol. And he shouldn’t be fired anyway. The reasons everyone was listing are just his flaws as if every single head coach in the league doesn’t have them. 



And it’s been ONE down year after years of greatness. There are tons of dudes on the team who have spent every year of their careers so far going to the Super Bowl. And also, I know this year is terrible by our recent standards, but we are not a “bad” team. We are an ok team by record. .500 is bad for us but there’s far worse teams. People acting like we have the jets record or something. 



When people demand to fire Andy, they never seem to have a viable replacement. You don’t fire a guy like Andy unless there’s high odds of finding someone as good or better. Those odds are extremely low, considering our options are guys that haven’t been head coaches before or have failed at being them. We won’t be able to trade the rams for Mcvay or something lmao.

 To be fair, I see a whole range of reactions. Yeah, on one very uninformed spectrum, there are the people who want to fire Nagy and  Reid every time we fail to get a first down in a game. Ridiculous, obviously. But I also notice people on here who literally can't accept any criticism of any players or coaches and cite past accomplishments as a reason to simply not ever express frustration when the team is very obviously struggling. Some people seem super threatened by the negative doomers — but that's the internet. You're going to see extremes. Fans are gonna fan. I always remind myself that the chances of a fan's mind being changed on here are really super low. I think what's interesting this year is that the team finally has its full arsenal of offensive weapons on the field at the same time and the results have been pretty mixed. Last year we were winning, obv, but it was often pretty ugly/lucky. We could tell ourselves that Rice/Brown weren't on the field. This year it's harder to cite anything like this — so that's why you're seeing more frustration directed at the coaches. Just my opinion.

Additionally here we have 90% of the QBs being within a couple percent points of each other, including most of the MVP front runners, which would ultimately amount to a handful of throws across the season.

If the Chiefs do this, and still don't improve, then we look at Spagnuolo, Reid, and Veach. It's malpractice to be mediocre with Mahomes at QB. Spags is going to be a real HC candidate this offseason with how he has kept their team in games with this defense that essentially cannot create one ounce of pressure rushing 4. There is a very real chance he is gone next year. 

Veach will be on the hot seat because the pass rush has been such ass with FAU (bust), Omenihu (bad signing the second time around), Danna (role guy paid as the 42nd highest edge), and Gilotte (possible bust). He has this offseason to fix that and the run game, which I do believe is achievable. 

Reid needs new blood in the offensive coaching room who aren’t yes men. They need someone to bring some new concepts and ideas especially to the run game. The ideal hire would be McDaniel as OC, since the run game is really his specialty. He had Mostert out there putting up crazy numbers at 30+. If Reid does go and hires another one of his guys as OC that won’t challenge the team to be better then we can have a serious conversation about him remaining the head coach. 

They have the talent on this roster though to still make the playoffs, but they have to stop playing so scared and push the ball more vertically especially in the redzone. They need a more stable running game as well since this like is getting push and Hunt is performing well for his age. I do think we win next week mainly because we match up well against the colts for what they want to do offensively.

We get dinged on D by the simplest plays and our offense goes empty backfield on 3rd and 2 in the 4th and the best we can do is a back shoulder throw to a rookie that doesn't know it's coming.

\-You constantly give up 3rd and long in pivotal situations.

Perhaps missing the playoffs would be a needed wake up call; it would also position them better in the draft to maybe grab an edge rusher worthwhile to position opposite of Karlaftis.  Reid & Co. (who is *actually* calling plays?) doesn’t do much early to aid in pulling one over on defenses *later on in the game*. 

I noticed it immediately when Denver started running it early in the 4th. Said to my wife, “they are setting up runs to pull the Chiefs closer to the line and create space deep for later in the quarter.”

Sure enough, when the time came they complete a 30 yard pass because they’d been running it and then got a man coverage look that gave them a shot at the deeper pass. It wasn’t complicated in any way. 

Reid doesn’t do that kind of game. It’s complex, flashy, and looks awesome when it works, but it hardly creates any sort of mystery for opponents from one play to the next. And because they replace runs with short throws (many times behind or at the LOS), teams don’t have to respect any expected running downs at all. They don’t need to make a choice, they just play for a pass.

If you know you can almost always play for a pass then it isn’t complicated. It’s why Reid’s teams don’t really run away with games.

I know it’s popular to flame the coaches this year, but this team has a ton of offensive talent and there’s just obscene lapses at times. You can’t blame the play-calling for Mahomes missing Tyquan or Worthy down the field on the first drive. You can’t blame Rice’s two drops on play calling. You can’t blame Taylor’s drive-killing penalties on play calling. These are horrid mental lapses. This is the second game in a row where the team looked like they didn’t even want to be there. Many of these players have 1-3 Super Bowl rings. I think a lot of them have bought into their own hype and have become fat (proverbially) and happy, so there’s a lot of half-assing it in games.

Why he says 2025 start has been ‘challenging’  One thing people often forget is starters like Jones who have been around for the whole Mahomes era success, have essentially played an entire extra season of post season games. That wear and tear adds up. Jones is in his 10th season but he’s also got 22 playoff games of wear on his tires that most people don’t see. And playoff games are more demanding than regular season games because players physically put it all on the line.

Jones and Karlaftis are clearly your LDT and LDE, but after Omarr Norman-Lott (who plays RDT) went down for the year, RDT and RDE appear pretty unimpressive. So in the upcoming draft or free agency period, do you go RDT or RDE? While Norman-Lott has shown good stuff, he has an injury history, and may not be as fast next season.

Or other teams that have poor family facilities on game day. They’re asking for facilities for their wives and kids. At the stadium. That they work at.

Kehoe, who has been in regular discussions with Chiefs executives, said there has been no talk of building a traditional domed stadium in Missouri. But that doesn’t mean there couldn’t be another type of covering over the Chiefs’ well-known home.

“There’s some interesting architectural improvements to make to Arrowhead that could be conducive to an all-weather protective environment without being a full dome,” Kehoe told The Associated Press on Tuesday. “I would say, look at some of the structures that are in Europe that may have some sort of fabric device that goes over it.”

Such a covering for Arrowhead is no sure thing, Kehoe said, but it could be one way to preserve its famous outdoor environment while still providing an indoor-like option that’s often preferred for major events, such as a Super Bowl.

The Chiefs declined to address Kehoe’s latest thoughts when reached by AP on Tuesday, referring instead to comments made by chairman Clark Hunt to local reporters before the team played the Washington Commanders a few weeks ago. At the time, Hunt said the club founded by his late father, Lamar Hunt, was still considering options on both sides of the Kansas-Missouri state line.

“I wouldn’t say we’re in limbo. Stadium projects move at their own pace,” Hunt said. “We’ve learned over the years that you can’t really force them to go faster, even if you want them to. And so it’s just important for us to keep working on both options.” Just put a big tarp over it that says Fuck The Raiders",1341360.0,negative

Kehoe, who has been in regular discussions with Chiefs executives, said there has been no talk of building a traditional domed stadium in Missouri. But that doesn’t mean there couldn’t be another type of covering over the Chiefs’ well-known home.

“There’s some interesting architectural improvements to make to Arrowhead that could be conducive to an all-weather protective environment without being a full dome,” Kehoe told The Associated Press on Tuesday. “I would say, look at some of the structures that are in Europe that may have some sort of fabric device that goes over it.”

Such a covering for Arrowhead is no sure thing, Kehoe said, but it could be one way to preserve its famous outdoor environment while still providing an indoor-like option that’s often preferred for major events, such as a Super Bowl.

The Chiefs declined to address Kehoe’s latest thoughts when reached by AP on Tuesday, referring instead to comments made by chairman Clark Hunt to local reporters before the team played the Washington Commanders a few weeks ago. At the time, Hunt said the club founded by his late father, Lamar Hunt, was still considering options on both sides of the Kansas-Missouri state line.

“I wouldn’t say we’re in limbo. Stadium projects move at their own pace,” Hunt said. “We’ve learned over the years that you can’t really force them to go faster, even if you want them to. And so it’s just important for us to keep working on both options.” the original plans for Truman sports complex from 1973 had a rolling retractable roof.

1oum8fj,1762899149.0,155,0.9,67,DISCUSSION,"Sean Payton’s “we felt real good” quote Chiefs fan here in Denver. I recently remembered that after their exit from last year’s playoffs Sean Payton implied that the Broncos were highly confident that if they got past the Bills, they would have beaten the Chiefs in the next round.  

I looked it up and sure enough he said this: “There’s a lot of confidence in this team if we could get past that game, the next game we felt real good about.” 

Kind of a little bitch thing to say IMO , especially when your season just got ended by a team that really handed your ass to you - just wondering if this has resurfaced locally in the Kansas City media, or is this just last year’s news? its not the same since it isnt from the team itself but i saw a lot of people saying the same about how, if the bills had beaten the chiefs, they wouldve easily won against the eagles, which is just about as silly",9486.0,neutral

As of right now they're outside the playoff picture, and every team that would currently be a wildcard has a tiebreaker (LAC, BUF, JAX).

Was just cool to see him in that role. Hope he's enjoying the bye. I didn’t see it, but have seen him talk enough to know he’s passionate about college football. The guy might know some of the players from watching clips of plays Andy’s “borrowing”! I read that he pushed hard to draft Hunt in 2017 because he religiously watch Thursday night MACtion in his office and cribbed a ton of plays or variations from it. Staying locked in to the cutting edge of offense is why Andy won’t have a Bill Belicheck game past him by period despite being close in age. And I think Patrick probably is tuned in enough at this point in his career that he’s bringing in ideas from college stuff he sees to Andy. 


I do think it would be wise to bring at one position coach or offensive assistant in from the Shannahan/McVay tree just because there are so many out there and if McDaniel and Kevin Stefanski get fired, a lot of the guys under them will be looking for jobs. The real score is getting Mike Kafka back if Dabol gets fired from NYG. My understanding is Kafka is a genius and spent 2017 basically coaching Pat 1-on-1. I don’t think Nagy has “it”or bare minimum doesn’t bring anything to the table Andy isn’t better at. I think Kafka might actually know things not directly taught to him by Andy and I think that’s a good thing.",29930.0,positive

The Chargers and Broncos playing each other still really helps.

We sweep Denver and win the home game against LA and I imagine our odds go WAY up. Having seen a lot of Denver games this year, they aren’t good. But they also can beat any team in the league that can’t block up the rush. I’ve seen this Chiefs core win a Super Bowl after winning 3 playoff games w/2 on the road. 


I think our actual odds of winning the division are better than Schatz model, but I will admit that despite annually way overrating Baltimore I have found his DVOA statistics useful and was a regular reader of Football Outsiders when Schatz and Tanier ran it.


One side note-It pisses me off every time I see WR Troy Franklin make a big play. I desperately wanted KC to draft him and he somehow inexplicably fell to the 4th round. Problem was we didn’t have a 3rd in 2024 and our 1st (Worthy) and 2nd (Kingsley) both look like good-great picks. Maybe we could have traded the first 4th that became Jared Wiley and Felix Anuduke-Ozama to get to the early 3rd? Despite being poorly positioned to get Franklin despite his fall, I saw enough of him at Oregon to think there was some “receiver making the QB” like Mike Evans convincing the NFL Johnny Manziel was a first rounder. Franklin wasn’t exactly Mike Evans, but Nix is a Pud who reminds me a lot of Derrick Carr-capable of making miracles happen occasionally late in close games but more prone to throw with his eyes closed or take a sack or throw out of bounds on 4th down. He’s a backbreaking mistake just itching to happen and 3-4 years of big hits and NFL wear and tear will remove whatever value he has as a scrambler. I think Payton (despite being the most egotistical coach this side of Bill B) is good enough to win games with Nix and a top D and will definitely win the AFC West at least once if he sticks around 5-6 years. I’m just skeptical it’s gonna be this year? 


KC comes out of the bye and beats Denver and Indy I think we’re back in the driver seat and #1 in national power rankings. We lose either and the Wild Card looks more likely. But I think this team could win the Super Bowl as a Wild Card if most of our offensive line starters play and McDuffie spends most of his time in the slot in the playoffs. Spags is the BEST, but his insistence that Chamari Conner is a slot defender against receivers and tight ends and Bolton can handle similar duties in a pinch is killing us in games like LA and Buffalo.",49710.0,neutral

 Ive got friends who are close to the Cowboys and Marshawn, and they are devastated today. They lost a good friend this morning.

Mental health is such a hidden ""disease"" sometimes (lord knows I deal with it) and if you deal with it long enough you develope masks to hide behind.

Marshawn will be missed no doubt about it.

Also drove out to The Star in Frisco to pay respects to the Cowboys org this evening. As you said, we got lift each other up. So check on your loved ones and just be there because you never know what someone could be dealing with.

Winning several 1 score games most of which came down a single turning point late in the game.  Call it luck if you want but the bounce came their way then and a win is a win.
This year in every loss, except for perhaps the Bills game, it was self inflicted wounds . Im not sure if this is a lack of focus or conviction but this team just feels uninspired and worse is how they appear indifferent after these loses.
Maybe the bye helps to right the ship.
Call me a doomer, but if KC does not beat the Broncos I really believe they will not make the playoffs.

I'm not sure there was a game last year that we were ever down 2 scores in the 4th quarter besides the Bills game.  Hard to find exact stats on it, but the win% for teams that are down 2 scores in the 4th has to be abysmally low, but the Chiefs don't show much urgency this year when losing.

I hate sounding like a spoiled Pats fan or taking anything for granted, but until Allen actually ends our season (and realistically more than once) those head-heads mean very little to me. It’s why it’s pretty liberal use of language to call it a rivalry when 1 guy has 3 Lombardi’s and has appeared in 5 while the other has been a game away 2x and has been beaten convincingly by the guy with 5. If Josh Allen or Lamar Jackson both get one Super Bowl win and another appearance, I’ll maybe consider that a rivalry? That’s both unlikely and multiple years away. Until then Allen is an amazing physical specimen with a lot more grit than say, Justin Herbert, but apart from a convincing win over Baltimore and a great loss in 13 seconds, not exactly “clutch”.",23920.0,neutral

He mentioned the Chiefs are going to have to pay Rashee Rice and Trent McDuffie very soon.  This makes no real sense.  Rashee is on rookie deal next year 2026, even if they give him a huge extension, they'll still backload it so 2027 is a cheap year.  Anyone we picked up now would be off the books by 2028.  Also he's missed a year and a half, and owes a lot of money in civil suits, can probably get him extended for a discount this off-season just cause he'll actually need a signing bonus.

McDuffie still has 5th year next year, and could also franchise another, but he's definitely a trade possibility if he's going to want around 30mil a year.  Our DB coach seems to be able to make a decent unit out of anything, so might be the place to go cheaper, as our Dline stinks and we draft poorly at is, going to have to trade/FA someone there.",226270.0,positive

First, AS11, if you recall, was winning playoff games. Mahomes was the missing piece, but pretending he is, essentially, the entire team is sophistry. Reid’s tenure in KC predates Mahomes and he’s still only missed the playoffs one time since his arrival. In fact, there’s ample reason to suggest Mahomes never gets to the heights he’s experienced with Andy Reid. This isn’t a Bill Belichick thing where he had limited success before Brady and none after.

I think the Chiefs got spoiled with Travis in terms of longevity and work ethic. And I wonder if that affected how the team viewed signing Chris to his most recent contract. That they assumed Chris would follow Travis’ example. 

Ignoring QBs, how many 36 year olds are not only playing in the NFL but still playing at a high level and with the same hunger as rookies?

Travis’s ninth season was 2021. No one was talking about him aging or slowing down. 

Chris has never had Travis’ work ethic (to be fair, most of us don’t), and he’s getting to an age where he can’t primarily rely on physical talent without more and more help in terms of training, diet, and targeted recovery.

He is still a leader on the defense and he still commands attention by offenses because of what we know he is capable of. Every NFL player will slow down at some point. It just might be Jones’ time now.  If he slows down too much, he could make the decision to call it a career and forgo his last season. But I think it depends on what happens this season too.

 Grace foe at least a few years? Mahomes has what, realistically 6/7 years without declining too much, not everyone is Brady, so out of realistically 5/6 seasons you want to give them a grace for a few years? There are incredibly high chances that once Mahomes hangs it up, we will go another 50 years without a SB appearance and you want to give them a few years of grace?

 Grew up in Chicago land suburbs, cheered for the Bears casually and parents didn’t let me play so never got that into it. Went to college in Kansas in 2016, roommates was a huge chiefs fan and took me to games and got me wayyy more into Football. I still would say Bears are my number 1 team as I am back in Illinois, but Chiefs are number 2 and are the reason I got more into Football. If they suck they suck, I’ll root for them no matter what, as have I rooted for the Bears.

I think a lot of people get really defensive about the team not being the number 1 team in the league because people immediately start to discredit Mahomes and compare him to Brady. Which who gives a fuck, Brady had his own career and Mahomes will have his. I couldn’t care less who will go down as the greatest of all time, it’ll never be a consensus anyways. 20 years later and people are still arguing about LeBron and MJ. Just enjoy having a solid NFL team.

Mahomes will eventually have years where he misses the AFC championship, it’s just inevitable. Hell he may even miss the play offs at some point, could even be this year. It’s sports, there will always be ups and downs.",2523.0,neutral

Run the damn ball! Chiefs throw every regular season game they play against bills - of the Pat era. 

Chiefs have won 0-5 reg season games against Bills.

Chiefs have won 4-0 post season games against bills.

Why would a Super Bowl team showcase their hand of cards against their main competitor during the regular season? Just so the competition can get ahead?

Doesn’t really matter tho - Bills will still gladly give up their early draft pics to the Chiefs every single season and not learn one lesson.

It’s almost laundering at this point.

Question is does this solve your D Line problem? I say no. You need DT depth, especially with the loss of Lott. But you now have another run stuffer, but the problem is the pass rush isn’t getting home. 

How many teams are trying to run on us all game? Not many because they’re all playing from behind. We need more pass rushers that can actually get home. Cut Nnadi, keep Pennel and trade for a pass rusher that makes a difference.",18936.0,positive

(They also don't make the super bowl championship t shirts on the sideline after the game. (And I'm still convinced if the game plan and/or adjustments were better them Kansas City Chiefs super bowl LV champions shirts were be in our closets and not in Subshannahan Africa.))

But now that I read your body text, I will instead judge the folks that chose that name. It's long, kinda clunky, and pairs poorly with the already long ""Washington."" But that could work if there was a decent shorthand (a la buccaneers), but you fucking gave your team - which  is in the nation's capital with a red and gold color scheme - Commies as their de facto name.

I get that copyright stuff is hard in the decade of our Lord (and/or Patrick mahomes), the 2020s, but anyone worth their salt would've seen that shit coming from a mile away. As is, it's one last middle finger from Dan Snyder. The worst part? The uniforms are even worse and look like a default template. Idk if it makes sense to change it again and give the team a fourth name in a decade, but I think it's a long road towards building any kind of equity with it. If I were Josh Harris, I'd be soberly considering it, and if it were to happen, line it up opening day of the new stadium in the district. You'd have an opportunity to fully put to bed the last few awful decades 

Ig the good news is that the football franchise in Washington went from being offensive to me as a man and is now simply offensive to me as a graphic designer. (Still 32/32 in the league tho.)

I feel like Dan-O is being pedantic for the sake of sounding clever and ingenious. I don't disagree with his assessment, but I questioned his premise that Mahomes being back to playing at a MVP level isn't a direct correlation to the strength of his O-line. What? Nani?! Why are we overcomplicating what is well known and documented? QB play greatly improves when you protect them behind an elite O-line, and the inverse is true. 

Tom Brady always played behind a great O-line, and the times he didn't, they lost the Superbowl. Football is fundamentally about protecting your QB while being able to harass and waylay the opponent's QB you accomplish those two things, usually equals a winning formula.

Now, it's also true that surrounding Mahomes with cerebral playmakers will raise the ceiling of your offense. When Mahomes trusts his protection, he is at liberty to play freely, and the fun truly begins. However, protecting 15 is paramount once you do that 15 is unleashed and ""Hell hath no fury like 15 unleashed.""",108743.0,positive

Andy completely losing faith in Butker and going for it on 4th down at a much higher rate than previous years is a big help.

Chiefs were 26th last season in 4th down attempts with only 17, even though they had a 70% success rate which was 3rd best in the league.  They have already attempted 17 (4th in league) this year through 8 games at an 82% success rate (3rd best in league).

It's felt like such a waste kicking field goals on 4th and short with the best QB in the league, and the success rates really back that up.",108743.0,neutral

Also we have the fear of the deep threat again. Watch any game, you’ll see Worthy or Thornton going deep and two guys on them.

Better blocking from healthier OTs has helped a lot as well. Basically all the OTs other than Kingsley Suamataia were playing through some kind of nagging injury issue, and Kingsley wasn't ready to be a starter. That's why Joe Tuney had to bump out to LT, and while he did ok, it severely weakened the spot he vacated. Kingsley has been better at LG than the relatively inexperienced Caliendo was towards the end of last year. But that experience helped Caliendo be more ready to fill in this year.",46604.0,neutral

I do think it’s a bit of an oversimplification or perhaps an over complication. This OL is SO much better than last year’s and it’s silly to act like that isn’t a huge huge part of it.


But there is still a lot of truth to it. You can see the improvement in Hollywood’s contributions with this stuff and can also see Hunt getting back to it now that he’s in on more passing downs. His rec TD this week was the perfect example. If you watch the film, you can clearly see him look back at Pat, diagnose exactly what’s happening, and reposition himself to be in a place to catch the pass.


I also think a big part of it is just having better pass catchers across the board. It makes us a pick your poison offense. If you send four DBs out with Worthy and Thornton on go routes because you’re afraid of a 50-yard bomb, the best YAC WR in the league or one of the all-time greatest TEs is gonna be open for 20 yards underneath. If you play man or double team them to try to take them away, the speedsters will beat you in single coverage.",31069.0,positive

Drake Maye is objectively a better deep ball passer this season.  He is:

1st in passes 10+ yds 
1st in passes 20+ yds
Tied with Mahomes (behind dak) for 30+ yds
Tied with Mahomes for 40+ yds
2nd in passes 50+ yds (mahomes has 0, iromically Hurts is 1st with 3, Maye has 2)

Then, when you compare the season stats so far, Maye outclassed him in almost every efficiency metric, which usually determines the MVP.

Completion pct
Maye 75.2% | Mahomes 66.1%

Yds / att
Maye 9.0 | Mahomes 7.3

QBR
Maye 76.2 | Mahomes 77.9

Passer rating
Maye 118.7 | Mahomes 102.9

Drake Maye also just completed a 7 game streak of 200+ yards and 100+ passer rating.  This has been accomplished by 4 other qbs 5 times in nfl history

Mahomes (2018)
Brady (2007)
Peyton (2004)
Rodgers (2011, 2020)

In all 5 instances of this occurring, the qb won the MVP.

This isn't voter fatigue.  Drake has actually been very good this season.  The question is if he can continue this pace.",132096.0,neutral

Pats only have a few noteworthy matchups; Bucs, Bills, and maybe the Ravens if Lamar is playing and they are in playoff contention. 

Chiefs will have; Bills, Colts, Broncos x2, Cowboys, Chargers, and maybe the Texans if they continue playing better. 

This also presumes that Maye continues playing at his current level. Maybe he does, maybe he’s on a hot streak now. Haven’t really watched him, so can’t really say to what extent he’s really reading and manipulating defenses, versus more luck of some variety. 

Riddick is right that Mahomes does have less of a cushion. At most he could lose two more games, and still be in MVP contention, and that’s against a tougher schedule. Whereas Maye could lose up to three games against a softer schedule. 

Honestly who cares though? This stuff if fun to talk about, but the midseason MVP race is always a bit silly as it usually changes a lot by the final stretch of the season. Contenders drop off, some fringe person makes a run. In the end what we (and in certain Mahomes) really care about is postseason success. And also the team being fun to watch again during the season. ",165120.0,neutral

This was likely the Chief’s plan from the start (to develop Pole on the Practice Squad). Just required a brief stopover in New York to make it happen.

Pole is raw but has really high upside. Not a guy it makes sense to use a 53 man roster spot on, he needs refinement and a red shirt year to develop. Perfect practice squad addition, and the Chiefs even had an open spot.

They were likely hoping he would clear waivers on cutdown day, but the Jets interfered. Pole’s got a lot of the raw traits you want in a developmental project. He’s got the movement and athleticism to stay outside at tackle, with a solid natural anchor and the size to play either tackle or guard. Dude just needs coaching and technique work - which he’ll get on the practice squad. Dude’s got an interesting story never played football before going to a JUCO (basketball player in high school), he’s understandably raw but has a lot of talent to build on.",49076.0,positive

“What About You, Mr. Lombardi, Sir, How Did You Like the Game?”

Vince Lombardi isn't a man to give compliments quickly. But the Kansas City Chiefs and their coaching staff got the supreme tongue-and-maybe-cheek praise Sunday night following Kansas City's 23-7 beating of the Minnesota Vikings.

""You put on a great show. Your players executed beautifully. Your coaches had an excellent game plan.""

The speaker was, of course, Vince Lombardi, who for lo these many years has been THE coaching symbol in the National Football League and the first coach ever to win a Super Bowl game. Lombardi, now executive vice president of the Washington Redskins, was watching his former colleagues from the NFL and the invading Chiefs of the AFC do battle for the World Championship.

Lombardi looked sharp and talked even sharper. He was asked if the Packers (his two-time Super Bowl champions, not to mention their NFL domination from 1961-67) could have beaten either of Sunday's foes.

Lombardi squinted, then smiled. “I think Green Bay would have given either one of them a good game,” he said, a mild note of understatement.

What did he really think of the game? “I thought it was a tremendous show. Kansas City did everything right that you could possibly do to win a championship game. They were prepared. They executed. Their defense was just tremendous.”

What about Hank Stram’s role? “That’s what coaching is all about,” said Lombardi. “Stram did a tremendous job preparing his team. Not just this week or this game, but all season. Look at the way their defense played the last six weeks. They’re a great football team.”

Did he think the Vikings were soft? “No, no. You can’t call a team that gets to the Super Bowl soft. They just ran into a team on a roll. Kansas City played a perfect game on defense, and they executed on offense under pressure.”

Would he say K.C. deserved to be the champions? “Absolutely. They earned it on the field, nobody gave them anything. That’s the way football should be.”

What about the difference between that Green Bay team and the 1969 Chiefs? “Football changes every year. You have to adjust to the times and the personnel you have. Green Bay was built on defense too, but we won with the running game. Kansas City did it with a great defense and good balanced offense. That's what it took this year.”

Lombardi watched the game from a private box and stayed until the trophy presentation. He shook hands with Coach Stram and several Chiefs players.

“You know,” he said as he turned from the field, “a championship is always something special. This one belonged to Kansas City. They earned it.”",69440.0,neutral

The Chiefs: No. 1 — The Hard Way

By Bill Richardson
Star Sports Staff

It’s a theme we’ve seen before — something that happened before January 11, 1970, never really changed the Kansas City Chiefs.

After ten long years, they’ve finally changed the image of the American Football League champion that would return to the Super Bowl only to lose again to the National Football League champion.

But the Chiefs made sure that wouldn’t happen again — and they did it the hard way.

No team in professional football history ever had a tougher road to travel than the Chiefs had in the 1969 season. They not only had to fight off injuries and adversity, they also had to fight off the tag that said AFL teams couldn’t win the big one.

⸻

Injuries Take a Toll

Kansas City’s long and bruising campaign started last summer when Mike Garrett and Robert Holmes were both sidelined early. Later, Len Dawson, the team’s quarterback, was lost for a stretch that seemed to threaten everything the Chiefs had worked for.

The Chiefs were 5–1 when Dawson went down with a knee injury in November, and the team’s hopes seemed to go with him.

But the Chiefs found out something important about themselves: they could still win.

Behind the leadership of veteran quarterback Jacky Lee and the hard-charging running of Holmes and Garrett, Kansas City stayed alive — winning enough to reach the playoffs when Dawson returned to lead them through the post-season.

⸻

Super Determination

If the Chiefs were a determined group before, they were something more after Dawson came back. Their defense was already the most feared in the league, and now the offense found its rhythm again.

It took a 13–6 win over the New York Jets in the AFL divisional playoff and a 17–7 victory over the Oakland Raiders in the final AFL championship to get Kansas City to the Super Bowl.

And when they got there, they were ready.

⸻

Second-Half Victory

In the first half against Minnesota, the Chiefs’ defense and kicker Jan Stenerud gave them a 9–0 lead, and by the time Dawson hit Otis Taylor for the clinching 46-yard touchdown pass in the third quarter, the game was all but over.

Kansas City’s defense made Minnesota look helpless. Buck Buchanan, Curley Culp, Bobby Bell, and Willie Lanier were relentless.

It was the kind of game that proved what the Chiefs — and the AFL — were all about.

⸻

A Well-Earned Title

As the crowd roared and the clock wound down, the Chiefs finally reached the goal they had been chasing for a decade.

A championship — the hard way.",8680.0,positive

Eventually it'll be like Monday night's game - we just dominate in the pass, opens up lanes for the running game, limit any cracks we have on our o-line cause defenses can't just key on the pass.

By EPA, the Chiefs are a top 3 offense and top 5 passing offense (better if you just look at week 4 onward) and a top 10 defense. By DVOA, they are a top 5 offense and a top 15ish defense.

In points per drive, the Chiefs are #2 to Indianapolis on the season, and they are #1 from week 4 on.

This is a fluid situation and things are subject to change based on what info is revealed and other feedback. But as of now, this is the policy and how we are enforcing. Thanks, guys! I was a violator of this and fortunately my post was removed.  I posted here an article that was linked to in a Facebook page called Kansas City Chiefs Fan Hub which had more than 20k ""followers"" and many comments by users.  The article linked to a spurious website that I won't repeat here but it was like [fanhub.fejiabdefg.io](http://fanhub.fejiabdefg.io) which actually had a fully written article with about 400 words with very specific ""comments"" by people and ""facts"" that supported a specific ""conclusion"".  It was insane.  

In this age of AI and bot accounts it seems that there is an increased ease at which people and computers can create false information and even create false support for that source.

I've seen these types of posts and articles around political dis-information which are designed to sow division amongst Americans.  This is the first time that I've seen a post like this (with quasi-support from Facebook accounts that were likely a mix of bots and real people being duped) that seems like it was only written to drive advertising views.  There were lots of ads on the site.  

In any event, sorry about that.  I did at least start off the post with ""Is this true?"" and the early comments pointed to it being false.",89856.0,neutral

It'll feel like the defense is getting completely diced up - and then you look and it's the end of the third quarter and the other team has put up 10 points. 

His defenses have given up the most points *ever* for Super Bowl winners - for the entire playoff run in 2019, for the game itself in 2022 - and yet in the playoffs I think he's absolutely diabolical. He seems to have the best situational defense in the league, and yet in the 2023 Super Bowl (when he fielded the league's #2 defense) he gave up the go-ahead score 3 straight times, and was the first defense to ever win the SB after giving up the go-ahead score on its final possession.

Game: Team Photo Day prior to Super Bowl LIV

Taken By: Steve Sanders

Steve Sanders' Thoughts:

Q: Why is this the top photo of the year?

Sanders: ""This isn't a game-day photo and it's not necessarily something that we always share. It was our team photo, but there was so much going on here. Practice had ended a little bit early and we were waiting on a few executives for the photo, but the players had all assembled on the risers and we were just waiting a few minutes while getting everybody positioned correctly. [Quarterback] Patrick [Mahomes], who was going to be standing in the second row, saw an opportunity to make a great picture and moved to those vacant spots in the front row that are meant for Coach [Andy] Reid, General Manager Brett Veach, President Mark Donovan and [Chairman & CEO] Clark Hunt. He looked up at me, gave me a nod and a wink, then came around the corner before taking his position there on the front bench. I took a couple quick frames and that was it.""

Q: What was the mood like during this moment?

Sanders: ""Everybody was laughing, but there's so much going on here. It circulated all over the internet and everybody was breaking down all the little pictures inside this picture that were going on. There's so much, such as [defensive end] Frank Clark showing [linebacker] Damien Wilson how to do the shark in the middle and [quarterback] Kyle Shurmur grabbing Patrick's leg. There are so many little things that you can find. You can spend a lot of time doing it. These guys were having so much fun and it just showed how loose we were going into that game.""",158579.0,neutral

Lions had some injuries, but so did we. In fact our offense was pretty depleted for our first two games. We also had to deal with Super Bowl hangover, which affected even the Brady Pats (they started slow in 2012 and 2018)

Raiders game was the *first time* we got to see our receiving corps at full strength. What would Philly look like without always having Brown, Smith, Barkley and Goedert? Or the Lions without one or two of Gibbs, Montgomery, ARSB, and Williams?

The question I’m asking myself is whether they can win close games this season. When we are comfortably winning, the D can play for the pass and shutdown teams.

They do this for both teams and have done so for decades. We see this not only in football, but most other sports as well. 


When it comes to NFL playoffs, the refs have traditionally swallowed more whistles and just let the players play, if the penalties weren't egregious. This used to be celebrated by fans, before they lost their minds over the Chiefs success. It makes for a more enjoyable watching experience (there's a reason people didn'tenjoy that TB/KC superbowl).

I was having a debate with my friends about which current Chiefs should get their numbers retired. We all agreed that 15 should be retired once Mahomes hangs it up, but I also said that 87 should be retired, to which we disagreed. They said that since we didn't retire Tony G's number, Kelce doesn't deserve to have his retired. I thought this was dumb. Tony G was excellent, but I firmly believe that Kelce is probably the best TE we have ever had. Similarly to Tony G, he has also broken several records and he's still playing dangerously despite being 36 years old. That's not mentioning the super bowls too. Sure, SBs are a team stat, but we can't act like Kelce wasn't a monumental reason as to why we won all of them.

Furthermore, I'll never forget the insane plays he had in the rematch against the Niners - that crazy catch on 3rd down to put us in chip shot FG range to send it to OT, and the play right before Hardman's game winner where bro fought for the first down with sheer fucking willpower.

They said that since we didn't retire Tony G's number, Kelce doesn't deserve to have his retired. I thought this was dumb. Tony G was excellent, but I firmly believe that Kelce is probably the best TE we have ever had. Similarly to Tony G, he has also broken several records and he's still playing dangerously despite being 36 years old. That's not mentioning the super bowls too. Sure, SBs are a team stat, but we can't act like Kelce wasn't a monumental reason as to why we won all of them. In the first SB against the Eagles, he caught a TD and had six catches for 81 yards (he was also our leading ""receiver"" during that season). Furthermore, I'll never forget the insane plays he had in the rematch against the Niners - that crazy catch on 3rd down to put us in chip shot FG range to send it to OT, and the play right before Hardman's game winner where bro fought for the first down with sheer fucking willpower.

Even if we didn't retire 88 (I very much believe we should though), I 100% do believe that 87 deserves to be retired without a doubt. I'm curious as to what the rest of our fanbase thinks. Absolutely retire 87. He is the best TE of all time, has the hardware and post-season success to go with it, and was an integral part of our dynasty and the greatest run of this franchise. Not to mention all of the off the field stuff and just how influential he is in the sports world. You don't retire numbers willy nilly, but if Kelce can't get his jersey retired than no non-QB ever can.",148613.0,positive

1: He is pretty objectively one the best TE of all time, statistically. Add his rings to that, and he's the GOAT, with only maybe Gronk being close. If he makes a decent playoff run this year, that won't even be a discussion any more.

2: He was drafted by the Chiefs and will retire a Chief. That right there is why we should retire the number without a doubt. He is iconic as a Chief.

  
Edit: Yes, Gonzalez had more TDs and Yards. but he's also had 5 more seasons. Per year, Kelce has averaged over 1100 yards per season. I don't think you can really hold it against him if he retires after 12. Noone wants to see him put his body through another 4 years (unless his heart is really in it and that's what he wants to do).",148613.0,neutral

I think the NFL will eventually do some sort of accommodation for retired numbers.  The Chiefs have 11 numbers that aren’t used.  Other teams have as many as 14.  I would probably plan on retiring Kelce’s number and Mahomes’ number.  I don’t know that Chris Jones deserves the same treatment.  Jones has been  amazing, but no one could argue he was the ‘best’ DT in NFL history.  You can argue that for Kelce and Mahomes.",148613.0,positive

1oayy2y,1760917712.0,2706,1.0,67,HIGHLIGHT,"31-0 Victory Formation before the 2 minute warning  Firstly I'd like to congratulate the Chiefs on thoroughly dominating victory. It was for me the first really fun game to watch, having the whole receiving corp on display.
 Secondly I have a question for rest of the NFL fans out there.  With a whole quarter of play left (plus 8 seconds) the Chiefs trotted out Gardner Minshew who proceded to do nothing but hand over to the RB. While I am agree with protecting Mahomes and not trying to run up the score too much, but at least trying to convert 3 downs in real game play could be beneficial to the backups.

One of the things we do know about Josh is that family is important to him, and takes priority over football. To the point that he’s made choices based on family that were potentially detrimental to the advancement of his football career.

Coming out of high school Josh had 27 offers from Georgia, USC, Oregon, Michigan, and other top tier programs. He chose to go play in his hometown at San Diego State University because he wanted to be close to his mother and grandmother (who was sick). 

The dude was raised by a single mom in a Somoan family (family is huge priority). He supposedly had a rough adjustment when he transferred to Ohio State (at 20 years old) because it was his first time leaving home. He’s still just a 22 year old kid finding his way in the world. If something has happened to his mom or another close family member (and it sounds as though whatever it is is pretty serious) I can see that having an outsized effect on Josh and him dropping everything to go be with his family.

CHIEFS KINGDOM BABY LET'S GO KICK SOME RAIDER A\*\*! I find it wild that we apparently broke Detroit. 

They got beat by two TDs.  Not the end of the world to lose a non-conference game on the road.  Just move on to the next one. 

But no, they got a defender suspended at a time when they're already thin due to injuries, and they've been obsessing all week about refball.

The biggest complaint seems to be that the refs got a call from NY to enforce a rule correctly.  Like, they're mad because the refs didn't completely blow a call in their favor.  Like, okay, maybe that makes it a closer game, but you're still losing either way...

1) Jones would say he wanted Frank Clark back on the team today if he were asked.

2) Pennel like some of these other dudes are still JAGS who can really only run stop. I love the dude, and he's been a contributor, but he's not special. Nnadi was a head scratching move, but the problem is more who you replace Pennel with, not replacing him altogether. There's a ton of guys who can give you either of their productions, that's why these kind of players bounce around.

He was talking about Simmons.

This all comes from Nate Taylor who is the espn reporter for the Chiefs. 

Before the Jags game he showed up on the injury report with an ‘illness’ designation. He ended up playing that game anyways though. Apparently what is going on now is in relation to that designation before the Jags game. Taylor said the more he’s found out that he’s surprised Josh even played in the Jags game. They asked NATE if he thought Josh would play again this season and he said it’s possible. Apparently this is not close to being done at all and there is no anticipated return time. 

All that being said and my perspective based on how Nate was talking is that something serious is happening with Josh and not someone in his family. This is just my opinion but I think he might have been diagnosed with something bad. Just the way Nate was answering questions he knows something that he isn’t supposed to share with the public and he kept reiterating how much Josh loves football.",72500.0,neutral

Haven’t many people ruptured their Achilles by playing on a slightly injured one? I think Tyrese already had a calf injury when he tore his. I know multiple Olympic gymnasts wore ankle braces/wraps and then proceeded to tear them at trials.


PS— I’m not implying he shouldn’t practice because I obviously have no clue the injury or extent and I’m sure medical staff would keep him out if he couldn’t.

He’s right that someone can do something bad and still learn from it and move on to be a better person, and he’s right that sometimes people are made to believe that they can and never will be a good person, so become their thoughts and turn into a shitty person after one shitty thing.

Lamar is literally already a hall of famer, man.  There's no two-time MVP in the league who isn't.

Brady didn't keep anyone out of the hall so I don't see why Mahomes would.  Manning got in.  The other manning who doesn't deserve it will probably get in.  Brees will get in.  Roethlisberger will get in.

If anything he's creating an environment where any QB that puts up any resistance to Mahomes' dominance is GUARANTEED to get in.

Josh Allen is on track.  One super bowl win or another MVP and he'll lock it up.  Otherwise he just needs to play at this level for another 4-5 seasons and he'll get it even without a ring.

Burrow is not on track because of his super bowl loss, zero MVPs and huge injury history.  But maybe he'll get it together later in his career.

Montana (79-94)

Marino (83-99)

Kelly (86-96)

Moon (84-2000)

Young (85-99)

Elway (83-98)

Those 6 QBs are the only ones I see on the list from that time frame. There's others, like Warner or Manning, that started their career in the late 90s. 

Of that list, 1/2 of them won a SB (Montana, Elway, Young).

It's no wonder the years in the study include the period where the Steelers started doing nothing in the playoffs. Something everyone should pay attention to, is that more than one of these things has come out and always starts at 2015, then refers to it as 'Mahomes-era'. They are adding 3 years worth of officiating statistics that would technically not count to what they are trying to say, which just shows how sloppy the study is.

Also, these studies mean nothing without 2 things:

First: The same break down for every single other team for that same time period, which should (theoretically, if they were correct) show that popular teams get bias because their popularity drives viewership. Otherwise you're suggesting that small market KC is being propped up over other teams that have MASSIVE popularity in comparison (Steelers, Cowboys, 49ers, some others).

Second: The same break down for every teams' 8 year peak in success and popularity. So peak Patriots, peak Colts, peak Cowboys, etc. Show that the NFL has done the exact same in each of those instances.

They really want the NFL and their technically correct data lets them push their agenda.

I read through it once. It’s authors are shockingly shameless in how blatantly they twist data. I might post a breakdown of how ridiculous their methods are if I have time this week. 10 min fact check on this bullshit paper yielded this:

It is correlational, not causal. The authors themselves admit they cannot prove conclusively that referees were intentionally favoring the Chiefs.  ￼

Its primary comparison is only between two franchises (Chiefs, Patriots), rather than across all NFL teams.  ￼

Subjective penalties inherently involve judgment; isolating bias is difficult.

The effect is strongest in postseason, the study finds less or no favorable effect in regular season.

Most importantly:

Between 2015 and 2023, the Patriots appear in five playoff seasons (2015–2019), while the Chiefs appear in six postseason runs (2018–2023), including five straight AFC Championship Games and three Super Bowls in that window. 

So:
The Chiefs sample includes roughly twice as many postseason games and therefore far more total plays and defensive penalties to analyze.

The Patriots share of data after 2019 drops off completely once Brady departs for Tampa Bay (2020 onward), meaning the “Brady-era Patriots” segment within this 2015–2023 window is truncated to the tail end of their dynasty.

But the media is gonna run with it because our brains are broken in every aspect of life and there’s an algorithm out there to confirm anyone’s bullshit

Also why limit it to only “dynasties”? Apparently they believe enough in their formula that the four pre-Mahomes playoffs games is enough to declare no bias. 

Why not expand it to cover any team that has had 4+ playoff games during that period?

I could begin to see the argument that since Kelce and Swift started dating there became a noticeable benefit to deep playoff runs by the Chiefs.

Why would the NFL be trying to influence games in the Chiefs’ favor though 2018-2022? KC is one of the smallest markets, and also relatively poor, particularly when compared to; NYC, LA, Miami, Dallas, and SF ",138821.0,neutral

I read through it once. It’s authors are shockingly shameless in how blatantly they twist data. I might post a breakdown of how ridiculous their methods are if I have time this week. A couple of notes: They do indeed control for the volume of games/plays (ex. the penalty yards variable is per-game, the first down and subjective call probabilities are per-penalty). And the ""Chiefs Dynasty"" in this analysis only pertains to the years 2018-2023, not the pre-Mahomes Chiefs in 2015-2017.  
  
With that said, this paper is full of questionable methods and conclusions, and it's not any kind of legitimate research. For the statistically curious:

* They seem to use linear probability models for the two binary dependent variables (first down and subjective), instead of something like logistic regression. They're not totally useless, but they violate some basic statistical assumptions and can produce untrustworthy results. For example, we can't necessarily look at the coefficient for the Subjective model (0.28) and interpret it as ""28% more likely to receive a subjective call"".
* Their R-sq values are very low, (ESPECIALLY for the regular season models), indicating that they can't accurately describe the patterns found in the data.
* They present several results throughout the paper using p-values with different significance criteria (ex. p < 0.01, p < 0.05, p < 0.1). This reeks of ""p-hacking"" and should be rejected from any respectable publication.
* Can anyone explain how they got their margin of victory numbers in the footnote of page 16? Am I crazy?
* Their models use a single team indicator variable (Chiefs vs. Not Chiefs), which lumps the other 31 teams together. It's entirely possible that the Chiefs' penalty rate was something like 5th in the NFL, but it was still significantly higher than the NFL average. This analysis should be repeated for each team (ie. 31 team indicator variables in the model), if we want any conclusive results.
* Their conclusions are unfounded, and sometimes they don't even match the results. Some statistical interpretations are inappropriate. They also assume by default that any penalty discrepancy is intentional (with no evidence), with no mention of other possibilities. It's equally likely that their causality is backwards - a team who is better at forcing penalties (or drawing attention to them) would naturally have more success, and that also correlates with other drivers of success (good coaching, potent offense, playing with a lead often, opportunistic mindset, etc.)
* And my favorite of all: their killer result that PROVES the game is rigged for the Chiefs. The handicap that has been given to the Chiefs by the football gods for financial benefit is.....2.4 extra penalty yards per postseason game. And an average of 1.12 additional first downs per game. This is a lesson in why we don't blindly trust p-values, (which are almost always ""significant"" with a sample size this large anyway). It's pretty obvious that the statistically significant result is not significant to a football game.",56790.0,neutral

Problems with this study include but are not limited to:

1. The study excludes penalties that defenses receive entirely, and gives disproportionate weight to postseason penalties, even though they acknowledge postseason snaps only account for 7% of total snaps each season. Given this tiny sample size, you'd think it is a given that regular season trends will not be exactly replicated, as one single penalty in the post season can drastically change the post-season average. They attribute variance in a small sample size from the averages in a gigantic sample size to referee bias.
2. Mahomes is the greatest QB ever at evading the blitz and extending plays. Who would have thought that the guy who makes DBs cover for longer than any QB in history on plays will make them committ PI more often, as they struggle to cover a receiver for 10 seconds? (This is probably the weakest criticism of the paper, though. I can't prove this)
3. This study claims that declining tv ratings led to NFL financial difficulties which led to nfl referee bias. This is literally a r/NFL tier conspiracy, there is no evidence than any of these are causal. How would it make sense for the NFL to rig games for the chiefs at the beginning of the Mahomes era in 2018, when they were not even in the top 5 most supported teams at the time? Why not the Cowboys, Eagles, Pats, Steelers, or Packers? Taylor Swift first showed up to a chiefs game in 2023 vs Chicago, which marked a massive increase for us in fans, yet the aformentioned teams still have a bigger fanbase than KC. These 'researchers' even acknowledge that their study is meaningless.

Unambiguous acknowledgement that everything presented in this study is purely correlation, not causation.

Page 29 Again: ""While our findings are consistent with financial incentives influencing officiating behavior, we acknowledge that a range of economic and reputational factors could plausibly contribute to the patterns we observe"" Literally admitting they can't prove any financial motive to rig games.

They also admit that their study excludes ALL non-primetime games.

Page 7: ""For regular season games, Sports Media Watch selectively covers games with national distribution (i.e., Thursday Night Football, Sunday Night Football, Monday Night Football, and a subset of nationally televised Sunday afternoon games). As a result, regionally televised games, which make up a substantial share of the NFL regular season, are omitted"". 3-4 games a week out of 15-16 is hardly indicative of league-wide statistics.

For context, Alex Smith was K.C's QB in 2015 and Mahomes wasn't even there yet. The Chief's didn't draft Mahomes until 2017 and he wasn't named the starter until 2018. Meanwhile, Tom Brady was still playing QB for New England, where he would still win them two more championships, in 2016 and 2018 respectively.

This would be quite the rabbithole to go down in trying to determine why the league would conspire to officiate the Smith lead Chiefs with a bias, while Tom Brady is still playing and ring chasing in New England. That sounds like a really hard sell.

But this year the line is playing much better and he has receivers he can actually trust. He's playing fast and playing on instinct now. The last couple years he wasn't throwing to spots he was only throwing when receivers were open.

I don't think it's even remotely an exaggeration to say the Chiefs could have been 6-0, and that would have been fucking awful for the Chiefs, because all the same pressures and talking points of last season would be back tenfold; now, ""the Chiefs are bad LOL"" which has given them enough space to actually get better by doing more than just the safe boring shit that gets you ""guaranteed"" wins like they were doing last season.

I'm sure people are sick of hearing about gambling so I'll be brief on that angle - the Chiefs are the 2nd best SB favorite right now (behind the mighty Bills, lol) and Mahomes is the #1 favorite for picking up another MVP, you can say whatever you want about gambling, Las Vegas isn't in the business of losing money & no team has been as disrespected as KC in terms of gambling odds/lines, so if even there it's them at the top across the board you know the tide has truly been turned.",1908611.0,neutral

Hutchinson cleanly beats Moore here. If Pat drops all the way back to the 45, he gets sacked. 

Instead, he senses the speed rush, cuts his drop-back short, steps forward to escape pressure, scans the field,  fakes a pass, then slings it sidearm to the open man.

No, you don’t remember that? Might be because the Chiefs still won that game 31-17, held the Raiders to 3 points in the 2nd half, and people moved on without ever really noticing that the Raiders had 0 accepted penalties in the game.

0 accepted penalties happen from time to time. It even happened twice on the same day in the last week of the 2023 season.

There are just so many from that draft class that I don't know who to tip my hat to. Yes, Karlaftis likely isn't as good without CJ on the other side but that doesn't mean he hasn't been decent in his own right. 


But so has Chenal. I will always remember his answer during his rookie meet n' greet to the press where he said he brings ""violence and physicality"". He has absolutely delivered on that


I hope we lock up Chenal like we did Karlaftis from that class

Sure Butker did his job for a few years but kickers really are a 10 for 12 cents. 10/13 from the field and  11/13 for XP. This puts him 25th in FG% (76.9%), 34th in XP% (84.6%) all for $6.4 million per year, making him the highest-paid kicker in the NFL.

I can’t see him around next season.  Kickers don’t grow on trees. There are more average or below average kickers than actual good or great kickers. He won’t be replaced, and despite all, shouldn’t be replaced unless he absolutely tanks. Remember when he had the “yips” previously? Big Red didn’t even think about benching him, supported him and then he eventually improved. The kick out of bounds that y’all can’t get over would be just like Mahomes throwing an INT or the defense giving up a TD that shouldn’t have happened or ST having some major issues.

Offensively: Josh Simmons looks fantastic. Jawaan has even been holding his own when needed. Travis looked good against the Jags despite the loss. Worthy healing up, Rashee back from suspension NEXT WEEK. With the core 4 receivers , pacheco/smith/hunt, and time to throw, we will be firing on all cylinders post bye week. 

Defensively: Im looking forward to seeing increased snaps for the rookies, especially Gillote, ONL, nohl, and Bassa. McDuffie remains one of the elite coverage corners in the league and still able to tackle hard runners. Watson has looked a bit better, still needs to improve though. Chamari should be playing a Derwin James type of role, especially in pass rush and limit his 1 on 1 coverage to a minimum. Very impressed with Jaden hicks and Bryan cook (cook is a little up and down streaky in coverage for my liking as far as coverage ability but he makes up for it in versatility and great vision. We need Chris jones to earn his contract, simple as that, Karlaftis and omenihu are looking solid. But everyone on the line needs to PLAY THERE ROLES. 

special teams: ariaza looks better for the most part, but my god I don’t have much else to add for this. We don’t look good, butker is clearly off and has genuinely costed us games. Penalties out the waazoo for no damn reason. Toub needs to tight them up and needs to do it quick",77220.0,neutral

There were definitely some soft calls in favor of NE, but I felt like the bad calls were super even and balanced tbh, the refs just sucked. I think the loss was more due to the multiple turnovers by Buffalo which is uncharacteristic for them 



Also, do they realize that the patriots winning actually *hurts* our playoff chances more than if the bills would’ve won? [see here](https://www.reddit.com/r/KansasCityChiefs/s/vxDCWJOYwY) so if Hochuli really wanted to do us a favor he would’ve had the bills lose",816779.0,positive

Mahomes has consistently faced tough competition in his division and the AFC to make it to the playoffs and yet he does.  Here’s what I’ll say about Brady in his defense, because it also applies to Mahomes

His continued success CAUSED the afc east to be bad.  

Why?  Well the losses he handed out for one.  But when you have an all time great QB in your division you are more or less forced to keep rolling the dice to improve your team.

New coach, new GM, new quarterback.  Sometimes all at once.  Big swings in free agency.

It’s like a slot machine.  When that’s what you’re chasing you have to keep pulling the lever hoping to see lucky 7s.

You might get one.  Like a Justin Herbert for example.  And you try to lock that one in.  But you need to keep rolling the dice on coaches and GMs and even just getting two out of three right at the same time.

And before you know it you’ve kept spinning and your QB is past their prime and you have to start over


That’s what happened to the AFC east for 20 years.  And what has been happening to the AFC Weat since 2019",66200.0,positive

You can't just say those quarterbacks weren't great by claiming they had it easy.

It's the NFL, any team in any game wins.  And good players/teams are supposed to beat worse teams.  And I'd wager that their schedules were far tougher over *all those years* than you're claiming here (especially since high finishing teams play ither high finishing teams in the following year, it's how the schedule works).

Mahomes has consistently faced tough competition in his division and the AFC to make it to the playoffs and yet he does.  Revisionist history. For one, the Colts and Patriots were in the same division until Brady’s 3rd year (2nd starting).  For the first few years of manning and Brady’s career the dolphins had a killer defense and ran the division

After the split, the Titans were on par with the Colts for the first few years (swapping division titles). Then the jaguars were on par with the Colts off and on for a few years and the Titans had a year they won the division towards the end of Mannings time with the Colts. 

After the split the dolphins were still good for a minute and then were replaced by the Pennington Jets. Then the Pennington dolphins, and then the Rex Ryan Jets.


There were good teams in those divisions. They just didn’t last long. Why? Partly because Manning and Brady’s teams beat them most years and prevented them from reaching high levels of success. That usually leads to owners and GM’s breaking up the team sooner than later.",4729.0,negative

Giving some mid to later pick to either team could be that next Chiefs DB that Brett hits on.

They don't run the ball enough to justify it anyways. We all know next year they'll have to then invest in RB pretty early in the draft. That's fine. That's the decision they made when they basically punted on RB in the draft this last go around.

What they should do is feed Brashard more. See if he can be more than just Jet McKinnon in this offense. How does he look carrying the ball 5-6 times a game. Spell him with Kareem on the short yardage stuff, where Kareem is legitimately good at, and I think the explosive element he can bring should be good enough. Certainly in the receiving & screen game.

But my goodness stop giving the majority of their carries to Pop & Kareem. That's not a 1, 2. They're the same back. That's just a 1, and a bad one at that, that's not going to break you any big runs.",64004.0,positive

Are the Chiefs better or worse than expected through four games?

Worse, though things are trending upward.

Most disappointing is the 2-2 record, though K.C. has faced a difficult schedule. The Chiefs added to the degree of difficulty for this season by losing the opener to the Chargers — which puts their streak of nine consecutive AFC West titles at greater risk.

There’s also this: The Buffalo Bills are undefeated and have a light schedule ahead. They seem to be the overwhelming favorite to land the AFC’s 1 seed, which would make a K.C. playoff path more difficult.

>Team MVP: Patrick Mahomes
No surprise here; Mahomes has been the team’s top player. Early on, he started scrambling more often while the Chiefs were down their top two receivers. He also implored teammates to hold him accountable this offseason as he looked to make real change to push the ball downfield more often. The result has been a noticeable improvement in the passing game, thanks in part to the emergence of receiver Tyquan Thornton.

>Breakout player: Tyquan Thornton
The 2022 second-round pick developed quick chemistry with Mahomes after joining K.C.’s practice squad late last season, and the Chiefs now have to find ways to get him on the field in light of Worthy’s return. Thornton’s rise from the practice squad to roster hopeful to temporary WR1 has been the team’s best individual story of the early going.

>Top rookie: Josh Simmons
Simmons hasn’t been perfect. He doesn’t use his hands as much as he could with pass protection. And his run-blocking remains inconsistent for now. Taking all that into account, he has performed at the level of a roughly average NFL left tackle so far. And that’s a massive upgrade over anything the Chiefs have had there the last several seasons.

>Key player who needs to improve: Charles Omenihu
The Chiefs’ pass rush, as a whole, started slow in 2025, but better days could be ahead. Karlaftis has put together two strong games in a row, and Norman-Lott — still getting to full strength from a training-camp ankle injury — should only improve from here next to All-Pro Chris Jones on the inside. If Omenihu provides the type of threat he did against the Ravens, though, the entire unit’s outlook changes.


>Best development: Chiefs improving secondary 
The combination of coordinator Steve Spagnuolo and defensive backs coach Dave Merritt continues to produce secondary magic for K.C., as the team has consistently churned out production, regardless of who occupies those back-end spots. I’d just like to point out the the chiefs have won multiple super bowls without being the 1 seed",145382.0,positive

Most disappointing is the 2-2 record, though K.C. has faced a difficult schedule. The Chiefs added to the degree of difficulty for this season by losing the opener to the Chargers — which puts their streak of nine consecutive AFC West titles at greater risk.

There’s also this: The Buffalo Bills are undefeated and have a light schedule ahead. They seem to be the overwhelming favorite to land the AFC’s 1 seed, which would make a K.C. playoff path more difficult.

>Team MVP: Patrick Mahomes
No surprise here; Mahomes has been the team’s top player. Early on, he started scrambling more often while the Chiefs were down their top two receivers. He also implored teammates to hold him accountable this offseason as he looked to make real change to push the ball downfield more often. The result has been a noticeable improvement in the passing game, thanks in part to the emergence of receiver Tyquan Thornton.

>Breakout player: Tyquan Thornton
The 2022 second-round pick developed quick chemistry with Mahomes after joining K.C.’s practice squad late last season, and the Chiefs now have to find ways to get him on the field in light of Worthy’s return. Thornton’s rise from the practice squad to roster hopeful to temporary WR1 has been the team’s best individual story of the early going.

>Top rookie: Josh Simmons
Simmons hasn’t been perfect. He doesn’t use his hands as much as he could with pass protection. And his run-blocking remains inconsistent for now. Taking all that into account, he has performed at the level of a roughly average NFL left tackle so far. And that’s a massive upgrade over anything the Chiefs have had there the last several seasons.

>Key player who needs to improve: Charles Omenihu
The Chiefs’ pass rush, as a whole, started slow in 2025, but better days could be ahead. Karlaftis has put together two strong games in a row, and Norman-Lott — still getting to full strength from a training-camp ankle injury — should only improve from here next to All-Pro Chris Jones on the inside. If Omenihu provides the type of threat he did against the Ravens, though, the entire unit’s outlook changes.


>Best development: Chiefs improving secondary 
The combination of coordinator Steve Spagnuolo and defensive backs coach Dave Merritt continues to produce secondary magic for K.C., as the team has consistently churned out production, regardless of who occupies those back-end spots. I think the ""who was the best Chiefs rookie?"" conversation at the end of the regular season is going to be Simmons just because of his importance, but I can really see Nohl Williams or Brashard Smith making cases for themselves.",45738.0,positive

Once Rashee is back, he and Xavier are likely to give us a 1-2 punch at receiver that we haven't had since Travis-Tyreek. With the O line playing its best ball in years, hopefully that will give us a taste of what this offense used to be like.

But the real magic doesn't happen until we have a RB who catches passes. Andy love love *loves* pass-catching RBs. (Think Brian Westbrook, young Kareem.) Jerrick McKinnon managed to look like and All-Pro for us in 2022 in that role.

We swung and missed on CEH to fill that job, and Andy clearly would like to see Brashard Smith grow into it.

I have been preaching and screaming for a RB since the preseason. It was obvious Pacheco has zero vision and has trouble finding a hole even it's large enough to drive a truck through It, I like how hard he runs but running hard and going nowhere doesn't help the team. 

I really appreciate how Hunt stepped up huge for us last year when we were in desperate need of a RB and I truly believe he gave this team absolutely everything he had. But I also think he gave the last his career had to offer us last year. He has the vision but he just doesn't have the burst to shed blockers after he hits the hole (the very holes Pacheco can't find). 

This team is in desperate need of even an average NFL RB. A slightly above average RB would be even better but just getting average play from a RB would make this offense almost unstoppable. I think it would be cheap to acquire either option as long as there is a team willing to trade a RB. We should be able to get an average RB for either a late round pick or late round pick swap or we should be able to get an above average RB for a mid round pick (round 4 or 5) and both options would not be a large cap hit. I would like to see us trade with Miami for  De'Von Achane. 

I think OP is 100% on the money about Smith, I think he needs time to develop and can be one hell of a weapon. But I think this team needs an NFL ready RB right now. We need someone that can come in and hit the holes and break a few tackles and get those yards after contact. 

Then to round out it all out and punch our ticket to our 4th straight Super Bowl appearance they need to stop being overly loyal to #74 Taylor. He is a drive killer with all of his stupid penalties! Since he was signed for the 2023 season (still can't figure out why they were in such a hurry to sign this particular player) he has played in 36 games and has 42 penalties. This is unacceptable for any player let alone the second highest paid RT in the NFL (cap number is $27,391,666 for 2025). We have a swing tackle that we signed for good money in the offseason, let's see if he can go a few games without a false start I also bet he can line up properly too. 

That's my 2 cents disguised as $100. Feel free to correct me if you think I'm wrong about anything. GO CHIEFS!!!!",4112.0,positive

A 7th round RB that made a couple catches isn't going to evolve the offense, just like 7th round pick Pacheco didn't evolve the offense, or Signing Perine to catch balls last year didn't evolve the offense.

The team needs an actual threat at RB in the run game, or teams will continue to play 2 deep 7 guys in coverage constantly, forcing Mahomes to dink and dunk it a lot of the time.

Oh shit almost forgot, Smith coming fast out of the backfield really fucked with Baltimore. He’s a guy to watch moving forward.  This is the best line that Patrick has had since 2019.  This is the best group of wide receivers that Patrick has ever played with.  Kelce isn’t in his prime, but is still a top 10 tight end.  The Chiefs secondary has consistently been good since Spags arrived.  This secondary is particularly deep.  Especially if they can get Christian Fulton healthy.  Linebackers are above average.  This defensive line may be the worst that they’ve had under Spags. And the running back group is mid.  The one upside with the running back group is that Smith has a lot of juice and should see more time.  And on the defensive line, we have two rookies that have shown promise.

But this was the best game plan & called game I’ve seen from the Reid/Nagy tandem possibly in the entire last 3 years since Nagy replaced EB.  My favorite aspect was the involvement of Brashard Smith. It's clear he's got some juice and he can definitely fill that Jerrick McKinnon role. The offense picked up against the Giants when he got more involved as well. I think that's a big key moving forward. ",109296.0,positive

But what we can extrapolate from that is that if you give Mahomes a clean pocket, he’s still the guy.  

We just haven’t had a clean pocket for about three or four years now and we’re still making Super Bowls.

That should actually tell you just how good he really is

I would just like to take a moment though and say that I think the clean pocket was part of the passing success but also in general, just taking these deep shots really opened up the entire game for them and I think that they really just have to keep committing to doing that

We talk about how bad they run game has been but it’s a lot like the Eagles this year who haven’t been very good at running the ball, but that’s because they won’t throw it down field so defense is just play so close to the line",23760.0,neutral

FUCK THE CHARGERS! FUCK THE DONKEYS! FUCK THE RAIDERS! CHIEFS BY ALL THE POINTS! AAAAAAAHHHHHHH I agree that 2nd half last week seemed like it might the start of something. I don’t know? But I’m hopeful, the scenario I wanted didn’t play out I wanted Baltimore to win last week so they wouldn’t be so ravenously hungry for a win this week. I’d say today should be a good test for KC if they can win today then they will be 2-2 with a win against a supposedly elite team. The Chargers loss was basically due anyway being that they are a league rival and the recent history has been so lopsided anyway. The Chiefs played good against the Eagles and the stool push.",15536.0,neutral

There are 64 starting OT positions in the league. There are DEFINITELY not more than 40 dudes that should be starting OT at this level. Most teams would die for the chance to improve at least one of their tackle positions.

That's why the Taylor contract isn't as bad as it looks to some. He hit FA. Any tackle that hits FA is going to get overpaid. The Bengals wasted a TON of money on OBJ for instance.

To top it off Simmons doing it with barely any help. Shout out Simmons and shout out Veach. Keep out QB safe young man.  The question has never been his ability. It's been whether or not the tradeoff between Taylors ability and his backups ability is enough to offset his penalty issues. Penalties HAVE to be taken into the equation. The last two years the gap between him and Morris was likely big enough you could live with the penalties. But with Moore, I'm not as certain. If Taylor wins 90% and Moore wins 85%, I would guess that's roughly enough to justify the presumed reduction in penalties. If it drops down to 75%, then maybe not. But I don't believe the gap between he and Moore is that large. 


Also, I'm curious how this graph factors in penalties? If Taylor gets smoked when he's 1on1 but holds the defender and then gets a re-do, does that still count as a loss? ",158722.0,positive

>Mahomes isn’t just delivering more throws downfield — he’s turned into one of the NFL’s most aggressive quarterbacks when it comes to launching the ball deep.
TruMedia’s data shows a drastic shift from years past. That’s especially the case on 20-plus yard throws; after attempting just 50 of those last season, Mahomes has 15 through the first three games of 2025.
The number of deep completions, meanwhile, is up as well.

>“I’m just excited for where this offense is going,” Mahomes said. “I know it hasn’t been the perfect product that we’ve put out there so far, but there’s a lot of good, too.”
Specifically, Mahomes has started to develop chemistry with speedy receiver Tyquan Thornton, who’s been targeted most often on the team’s deep shots. That included a critical play in Sunday’s 22-9 victory over the New York Giants, as Thornton pulled down a jump-ball catch for 33 yards on a third-and-10 late.

>“I think it just gives me the confidence, when guys like Tyquan come down with the catch that he did, that I can keep forcing the ball down the field and let them try to make plays,” Mahomes said. “We’ll continue to get better and better at that.”
For now, it’s at least giving defenses something more to think about.
The Chiefs offense, suddenly, has made an abrupt shift from dink-and-dunk to chuck-and-duck. And that shows up most drastically in Mahomes’ air-yard-per-attempt numbers — an advanced stat that had been in decline each season of his career.
Until this one, that is. 

>Even with this year’s long-throw improvement, Mahomes says the Chiefs can be better. Those one or two successful shots per game, he believes, could easily be three or four. Then maybe five or six after that.
For now, though, Mahomes sees reason to be optimistic about the direction of the Chiefs offense.
Especially because the deep bomb is back in the team’s arsenal.
“We’ll continue to get better and better at that, as well as with the rest of the offense,” Mahomes said. “But it’s always super-exciting when you get a chance to throw the ball down the field.” If the deep-throws-per-game stays on pace that would be 80 this season (assuming he won't be playing in week 18).

That included a critical play in Sunday’s 22-9 victory over the New York Giants, as Thornton pulled down a jump-ball catch for 33 yards on a third-and-10 late.

The Chiefs offense, suddenly, has made an abrupt shift from dink-and-dunk to chuck-and-duck. And that shows up most drastically in Mahomes’ air-yard-per-attempt numbers — an advanced stat that had been in decline each season of his career.

>Even with this year’s long-throw improvement, Mahomes says the Chiefs can be better. Those one or two successful shots per game, he believes, could easily be three or four. Then maybe five or six after that.
For now, though, Mahomes sees reason to be optimistic about the direction of the Chiefs offense.
Especially because the deep bomb is back in the team’s arsenal.
“We’ll continue to get better and better at that, as well as with the rest of the offense,” Mahomes said. “But it’s always super-exciting when you get a chance to throw the ball down the field.” Throwing the deep ball and Connecting the deep ball are two different things.

I think the lesson here is that QBs careers wax and wane just like anything else. But just like Brady wasn't done in 2013 Mahomes isn't close to being done now.

There is a risk assessment for investments you make, I would say all of them happening at once isn't common but..when you go..our offense is going to be zero run game, an aging TE who can't do what he once did...a 170lb WR(when you do have an understanding smallish players do tend to get injured at this level) and a WR who you drafted inspite of many other teams having him completely off boards due to character/off field issues.

All of these things have risk to them, all of them together probably should have started flashing red at them but they continued on and then it happened.",40424.0,

This is what I've brought up in game threads before anytime Taylor gets a penalty and people start demanding that he be benched or cut from the team, and it always gets me downvoted. People generally ignore OL guys and their stats until they fuck up and get a penalty, and then suddenly they're a liability to the rest of the team. Yes, frequent penalties are a problem, but they don't cancel out the good side of things.

Those penalties are nearly just as bad as a sack. 2/3 going to 2/8 and 2/10 going to 2/15 are drive killers. Let alone the holdings that set us back 10 yards.

Yeah I'm gonna go against the grain here and say that he is not a good player even if you take away the penalty issues.  I legitimately do not know what you guys are looking at.  The statistics about pressure % are misleading and make him look more favorable than he's played, this offense has many plays designed for Patrick to catch the ball and fire it almost immediately.  When Taylor is asked to hold up in a traditional drop back situation he ends up getting beat a lot. 

Andy always says nice things about his players especially if they're going to have to stick with him for the rest of the year, which they do pretty much have to.  It's crazy to me that we gave Moore a decent contract in the offseason but he isn't capable of outperforming Taylor.",175603.0,

His penalties are always untimely and when he gets beat he can get beat BAD, but you isolate those 6 plays he’s a well-above average tackle that most teams would want.
