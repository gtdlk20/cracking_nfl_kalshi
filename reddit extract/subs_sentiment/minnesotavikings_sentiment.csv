If hes being completely honest about that and im interpreting it correctly. Then this is a GOOD sign. It would show that JJM completely understands and has been able to successfully change his mechanics in practice and that most likely will be able to eventually get there on game day with more reps and as he becomes more confident in live reps.

Also what's hilarious to me. JJMs mechanics go out the window as soon as there is a sign of trouble, despite them being good in practice.

1ozivik,1763392489.0,127,0.96,75,,"3 Bad, 3 Good, One question Three bad things

1.  JJM in the first 57 minutes was bad.  No need to belabor this point.

2.  JJM didn't get a lot of help from his team mates.  5 drops on 32 targets is horrendous - about 3 over expectation.  And this wasn't new this week.  Addison and Jefferson have both dropped more balls than we have grown to expect.  Now some of the drops may be because JJ is throwing the ball with too much velocity.  But Jets, Addison, Hockenson, and Jones are all premium pass catchers at their position - and three of them are being paid very well.  They need to clean this up.

3.  Special teams.  Matt Daniels needs to go. Losing contain on the kick off return contributed to the loss.  We seem to have a big run back called back due to a penalty every week or so.  Either fire Daniels or start cutting some of these fringe roster guys if only to send a message.  I don't agree with people who said we should have kicked it out of the endzone.  There was a minute left, Chicago had all three time outs, and would only need to ""drive"" 25 yards to be in field goal range.  Do you have confidence the D could have stopped Williams operating in four down territory under those circumstances?  I don't.

Three good things:

1.  JJ in the last three minutes was good.  A QB who is capable of forgetting 57 minutes of bad play (while hearing the first boos he's ever had directed at him from his home crowd in his life), and go out and lead a go ahead drive, is a QB who has something there.  Now, he absolutely needs to be better in those first 57 minutes, but every great QB has bad games, and one who shows he can over come them when it matters is one giving you a something to hold on to.  he needs to demonstrate he can effectively run the offense consistently as you can't make it as a starting QB on ""heart"" and ""moxie"" alone, but at least having those is something.

2. The D was very solid.  They mostly contained Williams in the pocket and he didn't make any of the crazy plays he made in the previous three games.  He did let him slip out of a couple of sacks, but as a whole they did well.

3.  Pass protection was excellent.  The OL had a lot of issues to start the season, but has gotten much better the past two weeks, mainly because they are now mostly healthy.  

**A couple of bonus good things** \- because we need a bit more positivity:

A.  KOC going to a more run heavy scheme shows that he is at least a bit able to adapt to his circumstances.

B.  Dallas Turner had his best game as a pro.

C.  And while we can't make our candle burn brighter by blowing someone else's out, Darnold going out in his biggest game of this season and throwing 4 INTs clearly demonstrated moving on from him was a very reasonable course of action.  Now, I have no doubt that had we kept him, we'd be 6-4 or 7-3 (or better) as we've lost 3 or 4 very winnable games (even if we didn't deserve to win them).  But if the QB is going to fold in the biggest games, there isn't any reason to bother with him.  The only thing that matters is winning a Super Bowl.

**A question I have:** We keep seeing/hearing that McCarthy's issues with accuracy are ""mechanical"".  But....he had NFL level coaching at Michigan, and he's had a QB coach since he was in high school.  And of course we hear that his is a ""football psycho"" who works his ass off to get better.  So, why does he have substantive mechanical issues at this point?  To be clear - I'm not saying he does or doesn't.  Like most of you I have no idea.  It just seems to me that there is a disconnect between what we have heard about him as a guy, what his background is in football, and what we are seeing on the field.  So either the coaches are fixing something that isn't broken; lying to cover up other issues; or he isn't the product we have been told.",9266.0,negative

We have a struggling QB who seems to sometimes have success over the middle of the field, yet our $16.6 million tight end has virtually zero impact. 

Excuses are over for Hockenson. He needs to be cut after June 1st this next year so that he is *only* a $5.3 million dead cap hit. Josh Oliver is the best tight end on the team and I don't think it is all that close.

Darnold was bailed out by the defense on multiple occasions. The defense was near the top of the league in turnovers. 

Did anybody watch the Seahawks Texans game this season? Darnold fumbled in the endzone for a Texans touchdown and threw two picks, but the Seahawks still crushed them largely due to their top tier defensive stops.

Darnold has an amazingly accurate cannon for an arm, but he still is making some of the same mental mistakes he made here. He just has a better team situation to minimize its impact (Mike Macdonald's defense, JSN making catches in triple coverage, an oline that was speculated to be trash but is giving him plenty of time in the pocket)

It's like people just see the 14-3 record last season and can't remember the multiple ugly games with miraculous wins and are trying to compare that to the Seahawks that are beating teams up so badly by halftime, they're benching their starters. The team situations are not remotely the same.

Does he even stand out?

Obviously I am not saying JJ is destined to turn into one of these guys, I am just tired of people judging a 22 year old on 4 games. Let a development pick develop. We have nowhere near enough information to say if he will work out or not, but if we stick with him and he does turn into something like any one of these guys, that would easily be worth the patience.

Lets just see what he is in 2 years or so before we go back to dreaming of days where we were mediocre with a quarterback who never had a chance of taking us the distance.

Edit: Since people seem to be missing the point and implying I am trying to cherry pick data to imply that JJ is going to be the next HOF, that is really not what I am getting at. Of course you could look at Rodgers, Brady, Mahomes, Rivers, Roethlisberger, or a bunch of other all time great quarterbacks and see that their first 4 starts were very solid.

The point is that through 4 games it is near impossible to tell if you have a Rodgers (good start good player), a Josh Allen (bad start good player), a Johnny Manziel (bad start bad player), or a Deshaun Watson (good start I would argue a bad player at this point).",55173.0,neutral

1otj6dl,1762793904.0,476,0.93,223,,"I re-watched every JJM pass so you don’t have to.  It really wasn’t bad until the last 5 minutes. I charted and graded (100% subjective) every pass from the Ravens game, focusing on accuracy rather than decision-making.  Despite the stats, JJM was largely accurate until the last 5 minutes when things went haywire.  I’m going to divide the game between drives 1-9 and drives 10/11.

The first 3.5 quarters had disappointing results, but solid play from JJM.  There were 35 drop backs:

- 4 really good passes (Nailor deep ball, Jefferson out with pressure in face, Nailor medium deep on 3rd, Jefferson DPI where his right arm was held but the ball was placed nicely)

- 13 other completions that were more straightforward plus the DPI where Hock was held

- 3 non-passes - Trick play that should have worked if not for the blockers, one scramble to avoid a sack, and one sack

- 14 incompletions, consisting of:

*5 tipped or batted passes 

*1 throwaway

*2 slightly off target or well-defended passes

*3 50/50 balls to JJ - others have focused on these, but the passes were basically accurate (two jump balls, one goal line rocket)

*3 inaccurate passes (one each to Jones, Addison, and JJ)



So, through most of the game, JJM only had 3 really off-target passes and then 3 where he gave Jefferson a chance to make a play, but it didn’t work out.

The final two drives were a different story.  He still had several really strong plays (long completion to Addison, the scramble and completion to Nailor, and the fantastic TD to Nailor).  However, within the span of 17 dropbacks, he had 6 well off-target or late passes that were broken up and another pass tipped at the line.  That also doesn’t include the ill-timed scramble for short yardage with 50 seconds to go or the mess of a final play.  

Overall, my takeaway is that JJM was largely accurate and in control for most of the game, but the team shot itself in the foot with the two 50/50 balls and Price’s fumble, in addition to the obscene number of false start penalties.  The false starts and JJM’s comfort in late game situations will only improve with experience, but this is a part of the growing pains of a young QB.

1otixwd,1762793386.0,116,0.9,56,,"How to not set your young QB up for success: JJM currently leads the league in average depth of target among all starting QBs. Meanwhile, the Vikings are bottom 3 in rushing attempts this season. JJm’s aDOT right now is 10.3 yards per attempt. In second place is friend of the program Sam Darnold at 9.76 yards per attempt.

Additionally, in JJ’s starts, they have run the ball 20 times per game, which is good for bottom three leaguewide. In years past, they haven’t run the ball often because they run it poorly, but this season they are averaging a respectable 4.6 yards per carry on the ground, yet still are attempting very few runs (granted, playing from behind more often has played a role in this dynamic as well).

To put these stats in plainer context, what is basically a rookie QB, in his 4^(th) career start, is throwing it deeper than anybody else in football, meanwhile his team is running it at a bottom-3 frequency in football. 

I have my concerns with McCarthy’s viability long-term, but this is just not setting him up for success in the slightest. Such a high aDOT requires holding the ball longer to let routes develop, reading multiple layers of coverage to make decisions, making higher risk throws, and dealing with more pressure from the opposing pass rush. It’s an extremely difficult ask for a young QB and is a great way to fast track bad habits. We’ve seen very little sense of rhythm or confidence-building throws, and a total lack of consistency in running the ball. Further, some of the best drives with JJ under center have come when they’ve run the ball early and often.

KOC has a clear M.O. on offense. His entire scheme is built on an explosive passing offense requiring a lot of intermediate and deep throws and complex, longer developing routes. We’ve seen that scheme look elite when you have a QB who can execute it (both Kirk and Darnold), but when he doesn’t have the right QB for it, or the offensive line can’t hold up on the longer dropbacks, the entire often unravels extremely quickly.

It’s just hard to envision things getting any easier for JJ this season without the scheme being more rookie QB friendly. He’s shown flashes of having an awesome deep ball, but he’s not going to magically turn into Kirk or Darnold overnight. This offense can't rely on a rookie QB to get them 20-30 yard chunk plays consistently. I’d like to see a lot more running and a lot more checkdowns on quick developing pass plays that mitigate risk and don’t ask JJM to do too much.",5951.0,neutral

I have a basic theory about the rest of this season and it's that KOC is not going to be in ""only call plays to JJM's strengths"" mode. Rather he is going to call the offense in a manner he wants to execute it, and see if JJM can hang.

If we had won some more games with Wentz we might be marching toward the goal of, get the kid in and set it up so he doesn't have to do much and try to win games. But he didn't.

Now with the completion percentage what it is, I think we are unsure if JJM can take us there, so we have to find out. If he was balling, all problems are solved, but he's not, so the best move is to call what you wanna call and have JJM and the staff learn as much as you can as quick as possible.

Let's be honest, having Jettas, Addison, Hock, and capable #3's is a great situation to hop into. If he can't ball we are gonna know this year.

We will continue to mark things off Nala's to-do list with what time we have left up until our last minutes. 

Nala just wants everyone to know that we will play again next week. Next month. Next season. Next year. And even though our friends and family circle we enjoy gametime with will shrink and grow as time goes on during our short stop in this life, that please still just show up. Those memories we make with others will long outlive the sting of a loss or joy of a win or a record at the end of a season. And thats whats important - the memories we make with others that will keep us in their hearts even after we have left and are watching the game with them, just on a different broadcast. 😊

I mean realistically we need a big game from Hargrave, Allen, and Redmond (who continues to be our best d-lineman) to win the line of scrimmage not just for Lamar but also to stop Henry so they can’t establish a run game.

1oqloax,1762491990.0,407,0.96,85,,"How Kevin O'Connell's play calls work So on [my show](https://youtu.be/D9m8H68bn6s) I said that the Vikings' play calls, specifically in the run, use a number system. In [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/minnesotavikings/comments/1oqhyms/running_the_wrong_way_on_plays/) some people accuse me of making it up or speculating or whatever, so I would like to show my work. I'm not speculating, I'm basing this off of several copies of other playbooks in the same system, including McDaniel's, McVay's, Shanahan's, and LaFleur's. It's how this offense works, and how it has worked for like 20 years.

I actually did a big long series about it in the 2024 offseason called [Building A Minnesota Vikings Playbook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Et7RCQwF7bY) where I cite a lot more examples and go into more detail. But I'll give an example here so you know I'm not full of it.

Unfortunately my access to the 2019 49ers and 2018 Rams playbook has been severed, but I still have 2022 Rams and 2022 Dolphins, which'll work for these purposes. Attached are a couple of pages from both.

37-36, in this iteration, is mid zone out of shotgun. This is a page of 11p examples. So let's go through that top right one, thats a nice one.

**Speed R Tout F Orbit 36 Gain \[Can\] Run/Pass**

* **Speed R(ight) Tout** is the formation depicted. R means the Y (Tight End) is on the right. Speed/Tout means 2 back with the ball carrier opposite the Y and two receivers on the weak side.
* **F Orbit** instructs the Fullback (or TE sometimes) to do Orbit motion. That turns the formation into 3x1, but you don't need to add a play call word for that.
* **36 Gain** is the run play. Even numbers go right. I have a mnemonic to remember this that might get me in trouble, but think of a couple of Richard Spencer's favorite numbers, they're all even, and he's right wing. 37 is the same run to the left.
* **Can Run/Pass** just means the QB can check into that bubble screen if he likes the look. McCarthy did this on the first drive against the Lions to beat a blitz and get the screen to Jones, the one where O'Neill pancaked Terrion Arnold.
* 42 Un G Shell is the defensive alignment depicted for example purposes. 4 man surface, 2 LBs, under front with a ""shell"" coverage presentation (you all remember that from the Donatell year, right?)
* MDM means Most Dangerous man - identify who would make the tackle fastest and stop him.
* ""B/Money"" (see attached) is an instruction for that guard to block the man in front of him, whoever is in the B gap. The LT will combo with him.

OP in that thread brings up a good point, why call it 37 instead of saying three-seven. To be honest, they might say three-seven, or they might not want to because three and seven are code for a different thing and they don't want to get it mixed up. Hard to say.

This has been a consistent verbiage system in these playbooks for over a decade, based on the playbooks I've been able to get my hands on. Sure, maybe Kevin O'Connell decided to change all the terms for no reason this offseason and make everyone re-memorize, but that'd be an unprecedented move. You can also see this kind of verbiage any time the broadcast gives you a close up of the play sheet, so I'm extremely confident that this is still the system.

The Vikings also run plays from these books pretty much exclusively, so I know O'Connell hasn't changed to a new system. They have hit Jefferson on Drift a lot, so let's do that from the Dolphins playbook.

**I Rt P15 Weak X Drift**

* **I Right** is the formation. I formation w/the strong side to the right.
* **P15** is play action fake of a 15 run, in this case 15 means duo left.
* **Weak** is an instruction for the fullback telling him to lead block weak side. He knows that in P15, he's got a ""check flat"" responsibility which means that he checks for blitzers, and if there are none, he goes to be an outlet in the flat
* **X Drift** is the passing concept with a clearout and a basic for the named receiver. One thing that does vary playbook to playbook is what exactly X and Z are. Some say X is strong side and Z is weak side, some do right/left, some would even do it by number and call it, say, ""18 Drift"" to say that Justin Jefferson has the drift route.

And before anyone gets mad about playbook leaking, I promise, this stuff is known if you have anyone that ever played on a McVay/Shanahan tree offense in the building.

In my [Patreon video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Et7RCQwF7bY) on McCarthy (I have earned a plug for typing all this out for you) I went over both of the instances of McCarthy and Mason going different ways. Best I can tell, McCarthy is wrong on one and Mason is wrong on one, but I'm basing that on what I *think* the O-line is doing, so I can't be super confident. I also left a burp in there on accident, so you have that to look forward to.

>Each chair utilizes 18 transducers that vibrate your entire body to sync up your breathing and heart rate, all while playing guided meditations or soothing sounds.

> Live tracking of your vitals means the chair can adjust the frequency of these vibrations to help guide your body to an even calmer state, theoretically helping with performance on the field.

> McCarthy claims doing this before starts or even at halftime helps clear his mind and reduce his pre-game jitters.

>Michael Penix, another regular user of the product, says that he feels like using the chair helps him remember players better and react faster on the field.

That’s not how an NFL QB looks. They gather and throw off a strong base as if they’re on a shoulder width platform.

But come game time he essentially gets whipped up and loses his composure so to speak. And the mechanics are going out the window. 

If hes being completely honest about that and im interpreting it correctly. Then this is a GOOD sign.

Some of them cannot stop reverting to bad habits when the chips fly.

So while yes, it absolutely could be that he's just still too green and needs to get more experience at this game speed to finally relax and stick to good mechanics getting trained into thim, all could be true.  That still doesn't assure that he will ever relax and allow the trained mechanics to hold.    Could go either way.

Jokes aside, you can tell he falls back into bad habits during game day. Look at the way his foot keeps Coming up when he throws the ball.

Obviously I am not saying JJ is destined to turn into one of these guys, I am just tired of people judging a 22 year old on 4 games. Let a development pick develop. We have nowhere near enough information to say if he will work out or not, but if we stick with him and he does turn into something like any one of these guys, that would easily be worth the patience.

Lets just see what he is in 2 years or so before we go back to dreaming of days where we were mediocre with a quarterback who never had a chance of taking us the distance.

Edit: Since people seem to be missing the point and implying I am trying to cherry pick data to imply that JJ is going to be the next HOF, that is really not what I am getting at. Of course you could look at Rodgers, Brady, Mahomes, Rivers, Roethlisberger, or a bunch of other all time great quarterbacks and see that their first 4 starts were very solid.

The point is that through 4 games it is near impossible to tell if you have a Rodgers (good start good player), a Josh Allen (bad start good player), a Johnny Manziel (bad start bad player), or a Deshaun Watson (good start I would argue a bad player at this point). Lamar Jackson was 21 years old. Came in half way through the season for a struggling Joe Flacco after they had a three game losing streak. In comes Lamar, leads the Ravens to three straight wins, with those passing stats and 265 yards rushing and 2 touchdowns. The Ravens went on to win 6 of the last 7 games and win the division. 

Lamar Jackson then won the MVP at 22 years old the next season.

We do NOT have Christian Ponder 2.0. That much I am certain of. This kid can absolutely hang and can absolutely play in the NFL.

How far he exceeds Christian Ponder is a huge question mark, but JJ has flashed FAR more in 4 starts than I think I ever saw Ponder flash. He's making plays with his legs, buzzing some really nice looking passes into tight windows (that 60 yard nailor throw was something I never saw Ponder even attempt), and some major intangible things that, again, I never saw Ponder display.

I'm going to get that out of the way here, but you need to be more accurate in today's league. People can point to Josh Allen, Peyton Manning, or whatever future HoF QB they want to as a comparison, but they are purposely ignoring the disproportionate amount of busts that struggle their rookie season and never turn it around (not saying that will be McCarthy).

Maye completed 66.6% of his passes last season.

Williams completed 62.5%.

Daniels completed 69.0%

Nix (who we keep rightfully clowning on) completed 66.3%

McCarthy is sitting at 53.7%

We can go on and on, but the accuracy is one of the traits that has looked far more worrisome than people care to admit. No, KOC is not doing him any favors. Yes, Jefferson had a bad game. But he is missing some of the easier ones that every pro QB should make.

Either his staff is failing, his position coaches are failing, and/or his play calling is failing. 

I’d argue it’s all of them but the play calling is by far the most obvious from an outside observer. 

To have 48 called pass plays and 13 called run plays in a game which you were leading in for the first half and within 1 score of for the vast majority of the rest of the game is absolutely unacceptable regardless of who the QB is and even more egregious considering this is JJMCs fourth game. He isn’t ready to pass that many times in a game.

... and today is Nala's last Vikings game. She has to cross the rainbow bridge on Friday afternoon. This is my first friend I have had to make the tough decision for and see it through. I've lost brothers while serving in the military and 90% of my family through untimely passings - yet this one hurts the most so far. I had typed up a longer post in my phone but when I moved to my laptop to add photos, it didn't come through. 

From coming into our lives in 2011 while in Arizona, to moving back to Minnesota in 2012 and back to Arizona again in 2018, she has been a fellow SKOLdier from day one. Whether it was just a trip from the bedroom to the living room, from NW Minnesota to TCF or US Bank or even taking a road trip to California, Colorado or Arizona to watch the game - she always showed up. Always there to enjoy the time she had all of us together as friends and family to enjoy a shared interest; never caring about the result. Never overly critical of the team or staff (okay, maybe Treadwell she dogged a bit). 

What I had hoped would be a good omen with the Norse gods maybe bestowing a win upon us to help our small family roll into this s\*\*\*\*\* week on a high note, ultimately didn't happen. And we can't control that and have to just roll with the punches. But it put things into perspective. Even though today sucks, tomorrow will sting less and be better. We will continue to mark things off Nala's to-do list with what time we have left up until our last minutes. 

Nala just wants everyone to know that we will play again next week. Next month. Next season. Next year. And even though our friends and family circle we enjoy gametime with will shrink and grow as time goes on during our short stop in this life, that please still just show up. Those memories we make with others will long outlive the sting of a loss or joy of a win or a record at the end of a season. And thats whats important - the memories we make with others that will keep us in their hearts even after we have left and are watching the game with them, just on a different broadcast. 😊

... and today is Nala's last Vikings game. She has to cross the rainbow bridge on Friday afternoon. This is my first friend I have had to make the tough decision for and see it through. I've lost brothers while serving in the military and 90% of my family through untimely passings - yet this one hurts the most so far. I had typed up a longer post in my phone but when I moved to my laptop to add photos, it didn't come through. 

From coming into our lives in 2011 while in Arizona, to moving back to Minnesota in 2012 and back to Arizona again in 2018, she has been a fellow SKOLdier from day one. Whether it was just a trip from the bedroom to the living room, from NW Minnesota to TCF or US Bank or even taking a road trip to California, Colorado or Arizona to watch the game - she always showed up. Always there to enjoy the time she had all of us together as friends and family to enjoy a shared interest; never caring about the result. Never overly critical of the team or staff (okay, maybe Treadwell she dogged a bit). 

What I had hoped would be a good omen with the Norse gods maybe bestowing a win upon us to help our small family roll into this s\*\*\*\*\* week on a high note, ultimately didn't happen. And we can't control that and have to just roll with the punches. But it put things into perspective. Even though today sucks, tomorrow will sting less and be better. We will continue to mark things off Nala's to-do list with what time we have left up until our last minutes. 

Nala just wants everyone to know that we will play again next week. Next month. Next season. Next year. And even though our friends and family circle we enjoy gametime with will shrink and grow as time goes on during our short stop in this life, that please still just show up. Those memories we make with others will long outlive the sting of a loss or joy of a win or a record at the end of a season. And thats whats important - the memories we make with others that will keep us in their hearts even after we have left and are watching the game with them, just on a different broadcast. 😊

 Thank you everyone for the kind words, it truly means the world. I just got done reading all the comments to Nala as she is lying down while we watch hockey. I’m a bit too choked up to respond to each comment individually but will do so. 

I plan on putting all the nice comments in a book with all our photos of Nala on game day once we have had the time to process her leaving us. 

Again from my wife and myself and her two brothers - thank you so much for your kindness, thoughts and well wishes. In a world gone mad it is a relief to see there are still good people out there to be kind to a stranger.",404320.0,negative

I've lost brothers while serving in the military and 90% of my family through untimely passings - yet this one hurts the most so far. I had typed up a longer post in my phone but when I moved to my laptop to add photos, it didn't come through. 

From coming into our lives in 2011 while in Arizona, to moving back to Minnesota in 2012 and back to Arizona again in 2018, she has been a fellow SKOLdier from day one. Whether it was just a trip from the bedroom to the living room, from NW Minnesota to TCF or US Bank or even taking a road trip to California, Colorado or Arizona to watch the game - she always showed up. Always there to enjoy the time she had all of us together as friends and family to enjoy a shared interest; never caring about the result. Never overly critical of the team or staff (okay, maybe Treadwell she dogged a bit). 

What I had hoped would be a good omen with the Norse gods maybe bestowing a win upon us to help our small family roll into this s\*\*\*\*\* week on a high note, ultimately didn't happen. And we can't control that and have to just roll with the punches. But it put things into perspective. Even though today sucks, tomorrow will sting less and be better. We will continue to mark things off Nala's to-do list with what time we have left up until our last minutes. 

Nala just wants everyone to know that we will play again next week. Next month. Next season. Next year. And even though our friends and family circle we enjoy gametime with will shrink and grow as time goes on during our short stop in this life, that please still just show up. Those memories we make with others will long outlive the sting of a loss or joy of a win or a record at the end of a season. And thats whats important - the memories we make with others that will keep us in their hearts even after we have left and are watching the game with them, just on a different broadcast. 😊

 You have given her an awesome life full of love. I had to unexpectedly put down my 11 year old earlier this year that I had since she was a puppy. It was the worst day of my life and took a long time before I didn’t feel a giant hole in my life. Luckily I still had her sister who was from the same litter, and her brother to help cope with it. It won’t be easy but eventually it doesn’t hurt so much and you will start to be able to remember her and have joy instead of sorrow. My Sol will be waiting for her Friday to greet her and show her around I’m sure. 💜💛",173280.0,neutral

Whether it was just a trip from the bedroom to the living room, from NW Minnesota to TCF or US Bank or even taking a road trip to California, Colorado or Arizona to watch the game - she always showed up. Always there to enjoy the time she had all of us together as friends and family to enjoy a shared interest; never caring about the result. Never overly critical of the team or staff (okay, maybe Treadwell she dogged a bit). 

What I had hoped would be a good omen with the Norse gods maybe bestowing a win upon us to help our small family roll into this s\*\*\*\*\* week on a high note, ultimately didn't happen. And we can't control that and have to just roll with the punches. But it put things into perspective. Even though today sucks, tomorrow will sting less and be better. We will continue to mark things off Nala's to-do list with what time we have left up until our last minutes. 

Nala just wants everyone to know that we will play again next week. Next month. Next season. Next year. And even though our friends and family circle we enjoy gametime with will shrink and grow as time goes on during our short stop in this life, that please still just show up. Those memories we make with others will long outlive the sting of a loss or joy of a win or a record at the end of a season. And thats whats important - the memories we make with others that will keep us in their hearts even after we have left and are watching the game with them, just on a different broadcast. 😊

JJMc was insanely impressive at dealing with the blitzes.

Kick return td negated on one of the weakest holds I've ever seen.  The nfl wants returns changed kicking rules but flag nearly every play.

What is a catch?  I'm not sure the nfl even knows.
Justin Jefferson catch negated.  

The TD that for lions with in 3 was absolutely offensive PI clearly pushed off big time.

The roughing call that went against the lions at game speed looked like he drove him, but slowed down didn't look as bad, but the body weight thing is what got him.  

KOC inability to run 3 times in a row on the goal line left detroit with time....

Had a legendary draft class and the rest of his classes were decent. Even at the end of his tenure. I understand the hate but you could've done a lot worse. 

He took his big swings and I liked his reactions to problems. Such as dealing with Diggs, trading for sam Bradford after the Teddy injury, trying to fix the OLine with remmers and reiff, signing a prized free agent quarterback Kirk cousins. He's got his fair share of misses too.

Yeah make fun of his pick collecting but I liked his belief in having 10 picks. Allows depth, contract control, and trade ammo. I'd rather have more back ended picks than paying a ton of money for UDFAs

I was initially bummed out that he also was fired alongside Zimmer. Especially since their relationship had soured, but I also understand because that's pretty bad of a GM to not really communicate with your coach.",178632.0,positive

1ooqq72,1762317637.0,1036,0.95,120,Discussion,"He’s loves them picks Dark side Les Snead Ok I'm bored. Notable Vikings players that were acquired from the additional picks acquired *purely* from a Spielman trade back:

Cam Bynum

Blake Brandel

KJ Osborn

DJ Wonnum

~~Alexander Mattison~~

Oli Udoh

Stephen Weatherly

This is pure pick maneuvering. Any trade involving players does not count. This does not include the player selected with the reduced original pick such as Danielle Hunter, Diggs, Barr, and Darrisaw. Example we traded pick 80 for pick #88 (Danielle hunter) and #153 (MyCole Pruitt). I would only count Pruitt as value generated.

That list of free talent is incredible considering we were still getting really high end talent with the reduced picks. I am a huge Spielman fan if you couldn't tell.

And we have to be honest, there is a chance Darnold was the right guy, maybe he will overcome whatever internal stuff he has going on that makes him blank on the biggest moments of the season.

But the kind of FO I want on our team makes this decision every time. We are a good QB away deep playoff runs. The risk of signing Darnold to a big contract is way bigger that JJ busting...but the upside of both panning out is better on JJ's side. So you have big risk, huge payout vs. bigger risk, big payout.

If you sign Darnold you most likely don’t see what JJ can do at all for the next 2-3 seasons, then you have the Jordan Love scenario the packers had to try and walk through, only seeing one season of play before they sign a 5th year or extend.

Idk it was nice to finally hear someone from the national media who actually spoke on the situation with some nuance and not just ""darnold having good games, JJ 1 bad game, vikings stupid""  I'm not shocked that the modern ""hot take"" debate-style sports media environment,  which is designed to attract eyeballs and clicks, rather than increase the viewers' knowledgeof the games, has it wrong here. 

Even if McCarthy turns out to be Christian Ponder redux (which I am now confident will not be the case), it was the correct call. Our opportunity to win the Super Bowl with Darnold was last year and last year only. Regardless of Darnold's ""big game deficiencies"" (which I believe is more sample size and poor line play, along with the coincidence of having a bad game at the worst time, and therefore dramatically overblown), we would have had to pay him $30M+ *and* trade McCarthy to keep Darnold here. And we wouldn't have gotten good value for JJM, either, since teams would question whether we were giving up on JJM because he wouldn't pan out. We would have been fielding a worse team this year than last because of money, so we wouldn't be winning this year,  either. We would have roughly the same IOL as last year and probably a worse IDL and secondary as well. 

Instead,  we see what we have while McCarthy is on the rookie scale, and if we are satisfied with what we see, we get to keep building with multiple shots at a championship.  If he's bad, we clear the roster of old dudes and take another spin at the QB draft roulette wheel.",84294.0,positive
