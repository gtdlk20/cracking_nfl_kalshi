1p51s1g,1763941563.0,353,0.98,88,Discussion,"Grasping at straws: At least, Jameis is playing pretty dang well. **I get it** **:**

* Everyone is dead-dog tired of losing.
* People hate ""moral victories"".
* There is no column, in the standings, for close games.

  
With that established, Jameis is playing impressively.  This offense isn't even tailored to him, considering that he isn't much of a running threat, and he's still spreading the ball around and racking up points.  Even if he isn't highly mobile, he's moving around, quite well, in the pocket, and buying time for plays to develop. 

Let's also not gloss over the fact that he made an outstanding adjustment on the ""Bullseye"" throw from Gunner and then took it all the way home like he was a big-but-shifty tight end.  

**Yes, it was a loss but it was miles away from the kind of anemic performance we saw from the Russ-powered offense (outside of the Cowboys game).** 

Jameis is under contract, next year, for $4m.  That's not bad, at all, for a guy who can still compete at a high level. In an ideal world, we would have a backup who matched Dart's play style, a little more closely, but I'll take a backup who can keep the offense moving, regardless of play style, any day of the week.

1p2kgym,1763685900.0,154,0.96,54,Articles,"[ESM] The Giants could strike gold with head coach from the McVay tree >Every coaching cycle comes with a few names that rise quietly at first, then start echoing around the league once evaluators get past the surface. Chris Shula has become one of those names. And as the New York Giants begin another search for stability, vision, and leadership, it’s no surprise he’s already drawing attention inside league circles.  
Why Shula’s background matters more than people realize

>Shula’s last name inevitably grabs headlines, but the more interesting part of his story has nothing to do with legacy. It’s how he’s climbed. The Rams hired him in 2017 as a defensive quality control coach, and over the next eight years under Sean McVay, he worked his way through almost every defensive room on the staff. Linebackers coach. Outside linebackers coach. Pass rush coordinator. Then a jump to defensive coordinator in 2024.

>**It wasn’t a ceremonial promotion.**

>Los Angeles lost stars, cycled through role players, and dealt with a defense built with more undrafted starters than most teams would dare rely on. Yet the Rams didn’t collapse. They sharpened.

>This season, Shula’s unit has become one of the toughest, most disciplined defenses in football. They stop the run with structure and patience. They cover with modern spacing concepts that mimic what the league’s smartest offensive staffs are using. And they do it without a roster filled with blue-chip talent.

>One first-round pick. Four undrafted starters. No problem.

>**What the Giants can take from his work with the Rams**

>The Giants’ defensive identity has been shaky over the past few seasons, swinging from aggressive to passive, often depending on injuries or whatever crisis was at their doorstep. What Shula has built with the Rams is the opposite: a system that has a clear vision and elevates whoever steps on the field.

>Players praise his ability to communicate. Coaches rave about his preparation. McVay trusts him to make adjustments on the fly, and the Rams’ defensive cohesion shows it. They play fast, but not reckless. They play physical, but not panicked.

>That’s exactly the brand of football the Giants keep trying to rediscover.",8131.0,positive

\-----

Maybe I'm overthinking this, but it could explain a lot. Daboll coaches the hell out of the 2022 team, wins COTY, and it goes to his head. Remember the cigar-smoking struts? The massive friction within the coaching staff the next year (especially Wink)? He's all humility at press conferences, but volatile otherwise.

Then think back to Joe Judge and the 11-minute neurotically defensive diatribe, when he got himself fired even though the owners would have given him another year. Not to mention the kneeldowns that can't be explained by anything but the coach throwing a fit into the headset.

Then recall Ben McAdoo and his own weirdness after a successful season.

Could that be the pattern in the owners' hiring decisions? They're not hiring strong-willed coaches who can take criticism, expectations, and setbacks in stride. All of the best head coaches -- but not necessarily the best coordinators -- have that quality. That's leadership.",29572.0,neutral

But there are a few things that just don't make sense. So I am hoping we could get a mega-thread for all the speculation.

With that, I have a few ideas or guidelines that I would hope we can all agree on. If not, let's discuss why. 

1. This insane narrative of no first time head coaches has to go. I get the reasoning - it hasn't worked out great for us in the past few years. Yet guys like McVey, LaFleur, Campbell and others are proof that when it does work, it works well. Let's be open to that.
2. Be real about those with Head Coaching experience. If someone was a failed head coach more than a decade ago, that shouldn't count against them. Especially if they have been in a productive Coordinator somewhere else since.
3. Quit holding Interim Head Coaching against people. There's a reason the position was open in the first place. You are taking a current coordinator and crowning him as leader of an already failed organization which they have little, if any time to mold to their vision. That just aint fair.
4. Speaking of people with Head Coaching experience. It'd be good to point out why they are currently unemployed. That definitely needs to be part of the discussion - and what they could do to mitigate the same mistakes. 
5. Stop with the Belichek/Saban tree worship. Both of them were great Head Coaches for their respective organizations. However, neither one of them has been great at developing their coaches beyond the position they are hired for. How many fails have come from that tree? Do we really need to add to that list that includes Judge and Daboll?

I'm truly interested in seeing everyone's thoughts on these guidelines. It might be interesting to see how they match, or don't with Schoen's search over the coming months. 

Regardless, I do think we really should get a mega-thread for Head Coach suggestions/speculation. Mods, what do we have to do to get that to happen?

Daboll’s willingness to harm Jaxson Dart just to save his job has been a concern in every game he’s played and now he’s hurt him. That alone is a fireable offense.

Blowing 4 (four. FOUR!) double digit leads in 10 games should be the death nail.

The Giants have found a way to suck out all the joy and life these rookies brought in just 6 weeks. Can’t make it up.

I wanted the Giants to lose today. I still wanted them to play hard. And I was absolutely fuming when they actually did lose the game.

It’s not just time for change. It’s not just calling for the owners family and friends to get out of the front office. I want the Giants owners to sell the team because if Jaxson Dart becomes a Daniel Jones-like project and we suck until 2030 I don’t know how many more seasons of starting 0-2 and 2-8 I can take.

1or4mnj,1762545678.0,402,0.98,71,Rumors & Speculation,"James Winston wants to stay with Giants amid trade rumors, likely to be QB2 next season. - Jordan Raanan Winston told ESPN after Sunday's loss to the San Francisco 49ers that he wanted to remain in New York even though he isn't in line to play any time soon.

""I just want to help this team win,"" he said emphatically.

It doesn't matter that the Giants (2-7) have dropped three straight and are in last place in the NFC East. That hasn't changed the situation one bit.

""When a team gives me the opportunity and believes in me, they give me a job, I want to play for that team and do my best for that team. I don't care what the record is, I don't care what the circumstances, situation or facts is, I always say what I want for myself, I want for everyone,"" Winston said. ""I'm a solutions-oriented guy, so I want to be a part of the solution. I don't just want to run away when things get bad.""

""He's like a coach on the field [and] in the film room,"" Dart said.

""They're backup quarterbacks that have had a lot of experience, that provide a lot of value when you're in the meeting room,"" coach Brian Daboll said of having both Winston and Wilson behind Dart. ""They stay late with Jaxson, watch tape together, all three of them. Give good input. I think they're a good resource for a young quarterback.""

And that's just fine with Winston. He could easily have complained or been unhappy about his role. Winston has started 87 games in his career and is the NFL's most accomplished current third-string quarterback by a wide margin.

All this has only validated the Giants' desire to have him as their backup to Dart next year.

""That never was mentioned to me, but I'm doing whatever is required from any organization that has me on their roster,"" Winston said. ""I would love to help the young buck turn into the superstar that he is. That's God-given. I would love to assist in any way. But my dream is to be a Super Bowl-winning quarterback in the NFL. In New York, that would be iconic and legendary. Whatever that takes, I'm going to do that.""",28365.0,neutral
1or0eyk,1762536117.0,132,0.81,149,Free Agency / Draft,"2026 Mock Draft because I'm over this season I tried to draft a little differently than most mock drafts I've seen for the Giants to make it more interesting. I don't watch film but I try to watch as many college games as I can so that's where most of these players are coming from.

1st Round: WR Jordyn Tyson - Wan'Dale has taken a step up since Nabers got injured, but the rest of our receiving core just can't seem to hold on to the ball. Tyson can come in and be an immediate WR 2 and a potentially reliable #1 option if Nabers gets hurt again.

2nd Round: OG Gennings Dunker - I believe Dunker will be playing guard at the next level. I'm honestly not sure why people keep mocking tackles high to the Giants since Thomas is elite when healthy and Eluemunor has looked pretty good. Dunker could be an immediate starter at right guard, opening up our running game for when Skattebo comes back.

4th Round: S Zakee Wheatley - Penn State has not looked very good but Wheatley is a bright spot on that defense. With no third round pick, the Giants are gonna be looking for high upside players and rotational depth. Wheatley could come in and compete with Nubin for the starting job at SS. He could also be a rotational piece for the secondary.

5th Round: OC Brian Parker II - I don't expect Parker to be available at 145, but he would be an absolute steal in the fifth if he is. Like Dunker, Parker is going to be a tackle turned interior lineman in the NFL. I have the Giants drafting him to play center but he could also compete alongside Dunker for a guard position. The IOL is in desperate need of depth and Parker could be one of the rare late round picks that develop into a starter.

6th Round: TE Tanner Koziol - Koziol is an under-the-radar prospect that I think deserves more hype. Koziol is one of the few TE prospects that shows promise as both a pass-catcher and a run-blocker. He could serve as sixth offensive lineman on designed runs and also a big body red zone target for Dart to chuck the ball up to. I don't view him getting meaningful reps ahead of Johnson or Bellinger, but he will thrive in the right scheme.

6th Round: LB Jacob Rodriguez - Similar to Koziol, Rodriguez is purely a depth guy that will get on the field for designed options. With McFadden hitting free agency, the Giants should try to target at least one linebacker in this draft and they end up getting the guy who led the Big 12 in tackles last year.

6th Round: K Dominic Zvada - Realistically, the Giants would probably trade down to draft a kicker instead of taking one here. Gano is contracted on the team for one more year, but seeing how god awful our kick game is without Gano might scare the front office enough to draft one here. Zvada is the consensus best kicker in this draft and could provide the Giants some relief in knowing they don't have to worry about their kick game.",16038.0,neutral

1oqc6by,1762466000.0,179,0.89,233,Discussion,"A Look at HC Candidates Hello Big Blue. You may have seen me discussing this in multiple discussion threads here the last few days, so I figured I would make a lengthy post about it. I have gone down the rabbit-hole quite a bit on potential HC and GM candidates this upcoming offseason, and I wanted to run some candidates by everyone to familiarize ourselves and see what everyone thinks. Let me know if you would also be interested in a GM post. That being said, let's get underway! 

  
**First things first:** In my mind, all bets are off if either **John Harbaugh** or **Mike Tomlin** gets canned. They are not without their flaws, but those are the exact kind of experienced leaders that you want with your team. That being said, let's start for real. 

  
***Former Head Coaches***

Here I will begin with some guys who have had the head job before. I truly do think that these may be the guys we look at the strongest, and that could be the best move. Of course, they all have been fired for a reason lol.

**Mike McCarthy - former Cowboys and Packers HC**

Of course everyone knows McCarthy. We interviewed him in the past. Sure, heads may roll, but his resume is certainly good, and he might be the ""Tom Thibodeau"" type hire that we need.

**Kliff Kingsbury - Commanders OC**

He's had his ups and downs, mainly as seasons go on. I do believe though, that he is a bright offensive mind and the type of guy that would mesh well in Dart and this young core. I also have a sense he has learned from his mistakes in Arizona while learning from a season coach in Dan Quinn.

**Kevin Stefanski - Browns HC**

Currently the Browns HC, it's looking like Stefanski's days may be numbered. Tbh though, I think he had done a great job in Cleveland, maximizing a lot of the potential there. I mean, it's a losing job, and he has given them the most success they've seen in ages. A change of scenery could be what he needs. He also had some success in Minnesota with Pat Shurmur (yikes).

**Mike McDaniel - Dolphins HC**

Not going to say too much here. I still think he is a good offensive mind. He had a pretty bad team these past two years. Could be worth a look, but may ultimately be a better OC. 

**Steve Spagnuolo - Chiefs DC**

I know he's older and people may not want a guy with ties to the team, but he's legit one of the best defensive minds in the league. Loved by players and the organization, and they seem to love him. Call me crazy, ik his HC tenure was a bust, but I think he should be considered.

**Robert Saleh - 49ers DC**

Didn't do a terrible job with the Jets. He's familiar with the market and still seems to be a good coordinator. Also had good things to say about Dart. Maybe a consideration.

  
***Offensive Minded Options***

Getting into some first-time HC options, these are in no particular order. An offensive-minded HC could always be a good option, and it's essential to help Dart out. Look at what Ben Johnson has done in Chicago.

**Joe Brady - Bills OC**

I know another Bills guy may turn people away, but Brady has been loved by his players and has arguably done a better job than Daboll in Buffalo. Also a big part in success for the Saints and LSU. Sure to be one of the most frequently mentioned names around the league this offseason.

**Klint Kubiak - Seahawks OC**

Kubiak's name is heating up for good reason. He has done a spectacular job in Seattle with Darnold and that young core, and was also very productive for a bad Saints team. One of my top choices and feels like a matter of time before he becomes a HC.

**Mike Lafleur - Rams OC**

Just a really big fan of the Rams organization. One of the best run teams and the McVay tree is filled with bright minds. Lafleur is of course related to Packers HC Matt.

**Aubrey Pleasant - Rams Passing Game Coordinator**

See above. Pleasant also has knowledge on the defensive side of things, overseeing the Rams passing game through both lenses. McVay let him coach preseason games twice as well.

**Adam Stenavich - Packers OC**

Another really successful organization. Stenavich has been around the league for some time now, and even was in Michigan shortly. While not the playcaller, he has put together some really successful offenses in GB and helped to develop a talented young group.

  
***Defensive Minded Options***

Seeing as Dart has developed ahead of schedule, I think the door may be a little more open for a defensive HC, as long as he hires a good OC. Some good options here as well.

**Jesse Minter - Chargers DC**

A hot name in coaching circles. Jesse Minter has led a very successful Chargers defense and Michigan defense before that. He has learned from both the Harbaugh brothers and is a bright, young mind that is sure to be a HC some day soon.

**Jeff Hafley - Packers DC**

Another Packers coordinator. Hafley is over-qualified for the DC spot in GB, having been HC at Boston College previously, and finding success there as well. GB has had a talented defense the past 2 years, and Hafley deserves a lot of credit.

**Lou Anarumo - Colts DC**

Anarumo may not be a name that jumps to mind, but I think he deserves a mention. Did a lot of good in Cincinnati (who's defense has certainly got worse since he's left) and is part of a very successful Colts team this season. Defense has plagued us for years, and maybe this can finally be the move to solidify things, especially given all the talent we have. 

**Chris Shula - Rams DC**

Comes from a family of football. Shula has helped to rebuild this Rams defense post-Aaron Donald and seems to be a highly respected name around the league

***Wild Card Mention***

**Lane Kiffin - Ole Miss HC**

I don't think that this will happen, and I don't think it's a particularly good idea, but I DO think it deserves a mention. Probably the only college HC that we could consider, and I actually could see him taking the job. Still very unlikely imo.

**Before you say anything:** No **Jon Gruden** is not happening. Neither is **Bill Belichick** or **Brian Flores**.

  
So yeah! That's my list. Let me know what you all think and if there's any other names I should be aware of. Apologies for the lengthy post, I'm desperate over here lol. Go Big Blue!",37279.0,neutral

1opzb4j,1762436709.0,114,0.99,12,Data and Analytics ,"Jaxson Dart, Emeka Egbuka lead NFL midseason All-Rookie team. Who else earned a spot? **Quarterback**

**Jaxson Dart, New York Giants (Round 1, No. 25 pick)**

Cam Ward held this spot almost uncontested over the season’s first month, because he was the lone rookie quarterback to start from day one. But Dart surged past him in October and made this an easy choice at the midway point.

Despite having made three fewer starts than Ward, Dart has twice as many passing touchdowns (10) and half as many interceptions (three) as Ward (five and six, respectively) plus five rushing touchdowns (to Ward’s zero). Dart also leads all rookie QBs in completion percentage (62.3), yards per attempt (6.7) and yards per completion (10.8).

He is still playing like a rookie — his 46.1 percent offensive success rate is in the bottom half of the league, sandwiched between Carson Wentz and Justin Fields. But his early command of the offense and unflinching play style are promising for a quarterback-starved organization.

Runner-up: Cam Ward, Tennessee Titans (Round 1, No. 1)



**Running back**

Quinshon Judkins, Cleveland Browns (Round 2, No. 36)

**Runner-up: Cam Skattebo, New York Giants (Round 4, No. 105)**

Skattebo won’t have a chance to build on his impressive start after suffering a season-ending ankle injury, but he deserves recognition. Though his 51.3 rushing yards per game places him behind Jeanty, Hampton and Judkins, he is tied with Judkins in yards per carry (4.1) and rushing touchdowns. And Skattebo leads all rookie backs in catches (24), receiving yards (207) and total first downs (38).

Aside from the stats, he also passes the “vibes” test. The Giants’ offense felt wildly different in Week 9 with Skattebo out of the lineup.



**Edge defender**

**Abdul Carter, New York Giants (Round 1, No. 2)**

“Carter only has a half sack!” I get it. Ideally, that number should be higher. (The Cardinals’ Walter Nolen just made his NFL debut Monday night and already has more.)

But Carter is consistently affecting the backfield, as evidenced by his 32 pressures, which leads all rookies and ranks No. 1 on the Giants (three ahead of teammate Brian Burns). His pass-rush productivity percentage (6.7 percent), which includes hits and hurries along with sacks, is better than T.J. Watt’s (6.3) or Maxx Crosby’s (5.7).

Fans might be frustrated with Carter’s low sacks total, especially after he played his least-productive game Sunday against the 49ers, but Carter is clearly impacting the game.

1oo92wz,1762267684.0,209,0.96,43,Discussion,"12 years a Giants fan.. So I started watching the Giants in 2013. My friends said they were getting into the NFL and asked me who I'd support (We're British). I always support the first team I know about so in this case it was the Giants (because of Joey from friends).

Anyway, that first season I think we started 0-6 or 1-6 and I couldn't understand why people found this sport entertaining, as the Giants were awful to watch, and the word Boring pretty much sums it up, but I persisted because at least it was interesting enough learning all the rules etc..

Then something incredible happened.. we drafted OBJ.

For the first time for me, watching this sport became really entertaining! Sure the giants would still lose a lot of games, and a lot of them in true Giants fashion setting the tone for the next decade (losing by one score on the last play of the game) but watching a player like OBJ make incredible catches, and just bring the X factor to the team was worth it!

Then we got Saquon too, and he started bringing that same excitement, things are looking up! But they weren't.. and then OBJ got traded, and then Saquon got traded, and here we are. Without players like that it becomes boring to watch again.

The one thing I noticed, every single season since I started watching in 2013.. the giants have never had a decent O-line. And it makes me wonder what could have been if we did.

Either way, this season with Jax and Skatt and Nabers and Burns I think we can all see that there's something to be excited about again for next season. 

But I think we really need to give the offence the best chance possible to succeed. Get a top tier O-line together, and get another top receiver to help out Nabers. I know most would like Waddle, or for us to draft someone. And call it sentimental, but I'd love to see OBJ back in blue. Without trying to be biased, he's got the best hands I've seen in the NFL over the last 12 years and made catches no-one else could. Sure he may have lost some explosiveness, but he'd be the perfect guy for a safe and sure 5 yard slant to just keep the chains moving. And he recently said he'd love to play for us again before retiring.

Anyway, point is, as fans we've survived the last 12 years of misery, with a few moments of false hope. I think we deserve a good season, and it feels like we're gonna get one next year! ",8828.0,positive

But let's go into some stats about him.  Since he started with the Giants, he has coached 61 games and has a .347 winning %.

In those 61 games, we have:  Lost 17 games by 2 or more TDs. Which means every 3.6 games we are seeing a loss by at least 14 points.  From those, 6 games were by 21 or more points.  1 by over 28 points and 1 by 40 points.

In that same time, we have seen only 3 wins, where we won by more than 14 points.  So we're not seeing competitive football, or real winning football.

So the positive feelings you have this year, is because Dart is saving him.  But yet again, this year we saw staples of a Daboll team including unprepared with his kickers, causing us to lose games, letting games get out of control, without being able to stop the bleeding.  Causing us to lose games.  Causing us 3-4 wins this year alone.

Also, in his tenure, we have lost to the worst teams in the NFL including the Jets, Panthers and the Saints.

That is not even talking about all the players that have left his regime, that got the blame, and became winners.

Or the coaches he blamed, that left, and also became winners.

Or that he took control of the play calling last year, and averaged 16 points a game.

There is nothing about this coach that makes him a good coach.  It's just that as Giants fans we are so use to bad football, and believe the myth that patience will get us wins.  When was the last time a coach with a .347 winning % over 60 games turned it around and won a SB?

I can't watch another season of this.  The pieces are here, I don't trust them with those pieces.  And I don't want to have another season of seeing horrible decisions costing us games and possibly the playoffs.

They’re the common denominators that have run our beloved team into the ground across multiple regimes since 2012. A few weeks ago I lamented that the Giants defense always gives up points immediately after scoring themselves. They haven’t had a defensive stop after a score since Week 6. How does Shane Bowen still have a job?

I targeted McDonnell, Mara and Abrams because I thought them being out of the office with John still owning the team could be a possibly symbiotic relationship. It’s not. Ownership is being set up to make the impossible choice of sticking with Daboll for 2026 to develop Dart and keep the infectious stench of losing his tenure has brought, or wipe the slate clean and risk Dart’s development. It’s the same impossible choice they forced on Schoen and Daboll in 2022 whether they wanted to stick with Jones and Saquon or start fresh. The Giants haven’t gotten their timing right since Coughlin and Eli, and it’s why firing Schoen and Daboll after last year would’ve made sense.

I now think it’s nearly impossible for the Giants to be competitive as long as Mara and Tisch are the owners. For as much as Bowen needs to go, we need to have a conversation about the Mara’s and Tisch’s being forced to sell the team. That might be the only way forward at this point…

P.S.- Gano still has a $5.7M cap hit and Slayton’s still making $36M through 2027. Two guys that desperately need to be cut.

P.S.S.- I don’t blame Dexter Lawrence for being pissed at Carl Banks for his comments and being pissed at the Giants for wasting his career while his best friends are all succeeding with other teams, but Banks has every right to sound off on his play and us fans have a right to be pissed at him. Dexter’s energy has become infectious for all the wrong reasons, it’s showing in his play and it’s seeped into the rest of the locker room. He might be the best nose tackle in NFL history, but a leader he is not. He’s followed the example instead of setting his own.

1olreuz,1762012715.0,256,0.98,61,Rumors & Speculation,"[Dianna Russini] The Giants do not plan to move pass rusher Kayvon Thibodeaux. They previously told inquiring teams that the price would be a first-round pick. Other relevant news from the article: 

* *The Raiders have fielded calls from the Steelers and Bills on WR Jakobi Meyers, but Las Vegas has set a high price. Pittsburgh is looking at other wide receiver options, too.*
* *The Jaguars are looking for a defensive tackle. They have received lots of interest in WR Brian Thomas Jr., but no substantial offers. Most around the league believe it would take a first-round pick and then some to land the 2024 Pro Bowler.*

  
*Last offseason, the Packers submitted a proposal to outlaw the tush push, a play that the defending champion Eagles have perfected. The league came close to banning it, but with an assist from Jason Kelce’s* [*impassioned in-person plea*](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6373063/2025/05/21/eagles-tush-push-vote-campaign-inside-story/)*, teams ultimately voted in favor of keeping the play.*

*But eight weeks into this season, the thing that might actually kill the tush push is the league’s inability* [*to officiate it properly*](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6737672/2025/10/21/tush-push-officiating-nfl/)*.*

*As one high-ranking league source put it this week: “How embarrassing for the league to say we have to take away a totally legal play because we’re not good enough to officiate it.”*

*Don’t be surprised if this becomes one of the most hotly debated rule discussions of the offseason, again.*

*We’re always trying to piece together what’s going on in Philly, and I fully admit I’ve spent time picturing what a Brian Daboll-Jaxson Dart film session looks like when they are both fired up.*



*Now we might actually get to see it.*



*“Hard Knocks” is back in the NFC East. The HBO cameras have returned to team facilities to begin some early shooting and will be going full throttle in about a month for the December in-season series that will focus on the Cowboys, Commanders, Giants and Eagles. I’m going to take a wild guess and say that GM Joe Schoen will be avoiding any extra camera time this time around.*

The one thing I’ve noticed with Daboll, versus the revolving door of head coaches we’ve had since Coughlin, is that even after four seasons of mostly poor performance, there’s still a strong belief within the Football media, that he might not be doing a great job here, but they believe he’s capable of it.

Pat Shurmur, I think people thought of him as a good football mind but not good head coach material

With Mcadoo well he sat Eli, the media was unanimous with their opinion of him.

 Judge, well everyone thought very little of him from the get go and it was evident on the field

If you watch the Rich Eisen show, any form of Giants media, The Athletic, what have you, they all seem to feel that Daboll is still capable of being that head coach we hoped he would be. My question for you Reddit is, what makes him so much different than the others?

1oguq17,1761509738.0,263,0.84,185,Discussion,"Time for change Few thoughts:

Coaching: for the past two years Daboll’s been on the hot seat. I’ve understood both sides and have tried to think as rationally about it as possible. Tried to give Daboll the benefit of the doubt regarding the roster. But, he needs to go. I’ve enjoyed Dart and what he’s done this year, but I don’t think it’s solely because of Daboll. Daboll has shown time and time again that he cannot lead a team. More often than not, one unit plays well, but the others lack. He’s had enough time, but his incompetence is constantly shown through the amount of dumb penalties we get, not creative play calling, and lack to complete a full game.

Bowen: this dude blows. Players don’t trust him, never gives an advantage, and is constantly putting the defense in a bad spot. Everyone knows he’s garbage. But, this ultimately points to Daboll more than anything. Coaches didn’t want the position, so we’re left with this guy who’s ultimately become a martyr for Daboll

Schoen: Wanted Schoen to work out so bad. Really liked his process. But, man this guys just doesn’t have good results. The roster is ok, but it’s always filled with too many holes. Our receivers aren’t good. Tight end’s are mediocre, Oline has slightly improved but man could be better. And then the defense, who is supposed to be the crown jewel of this team, is so inconsistent. 

Slayton: This guy is such a loser. Been a giants fan for 20 years. Man, this dude just gives off such loser energy. He is so mediocre and Schoen is paying his ass for the next 2 years. 

Positives: Dart and Skat (Rip my sweet prince). Burns is insane. Thibs looks good. Nabers back next year. This team has some good bones. Hopefully a new regime can help take us to the next level, rather than tear everything down",41091.0,negative

Yeah people complaining about Kafka are fucking nuts. When your defense is hemorrhaging free TDs sporadically, I don't mind trusting your offense to put the game away.

Ironically enough, what I find the big question mark is not just running the ball three times first. But, he's an interim and first-time head coach. Shit happens. 

Bowen continuing to be completely useless is the travesty. Even Vilma notices it right away. Our personnel is subpar and we get beat a lot, but the number of untouched runs was disgraceful and indicative of awful coaching.",714757.0,negative

The reason they aren’t the permanent is two fold 1) ownership has bad memories with this design 2) other teams have similar designs. The second doesn’t actually matter. Prior to Giants winning their first Super Bowl the franchise was a joke (we’ve been terrible for a while but still get some respect), and this design was similar to the jerseys of that era. As a result ownership has bad memories with these designs. Mara took on a bigger role since we’ve reverted to the NY logo and current uniform scheme. He’s won two Super Bowls in those generic away uniforms (they are the same as the Niners away jerseys save for another stripe). 

This happens with a few franchises, changes in ownership often results in changes in uniform scheme. The Bucs creamsicles are elite jerseys but they had a horrific  record with those.

>Shula’s last name inevitably grabs headlines, but the more interesting part of his story has nothing to do with legacy. It’s how he’s climbed. The Rams hired him in 2017 as a defensive quality control coach, and over the next eight years under Sean McVay, he worked his way through almost every defensive room on the staff. Linebackers coach.

>**It wasn’t a ceremonial promotion.**

>Los Angeles lost stars, cycled through role players, and dealt with a defense built with more undrafted starters than most teams would dare rely on. Yet the Rams didn’t collapse. They sharpened.

>This season, Shula’s unit has become one of the toughest, most disciplined defenses in football. They stop the run with structure and patience. They cover with modern spacing concepts that mimic what the league’s smartest offensive staffs are using. And they do it without a roster filled with blue-chip talent.

>The Giants’ defensive identity has been shaky over the past few seasons, swinging from aggressive to passive, often depending on injuries or whatever crisis was at their doorstep.

>That’s exactly the brand of football the Giants keep trying to rediscover. for anyone that actually -watched- the glazer report last week, he specifically said he was high on Shula, not just because hes coached and is close to McVay, but that McVay runs everything he does by Shula, not because he has to, but because hes grooming Shula to be a HC one day. He works very close Shula in order to prepare him as best he can.

Im not sure how, but that aspect of Glazer's report seems to always get ignored while I also think its quite possibly one of the most important. Its one thing to just coach under someone, its another when they actively do their job with you in order for you to get as close to hands on experience as possible.

 Jesse Buss got promoted to Assistant GM in 2015 and inherited an awful roster that was cash strapped after several bad contracts and trades in an effort to get Kobe a ring in his twilight. The team had to build a plan to overcome the retirement of a league legend who had become synonymous with the Lakers after a nearly 20 year tenure. He played a key role in the scouting department that went through a 3 year rebuild and drafted a team full of promising young players that he then parlayed into trading for AD and getting the Lakers a championship. Then years later, when LeBron and AD were pushing past their respective primes and the future of the team was uncertain, the FO fleeced the Mavs to acquire the next superstar that will usher in a new era of success for them. He also played a key role in scouting AR, a guy averaging 28 PPG right now as a third option who went undrafted out of Arkansas, along with a slew of other 2nd round and undrafted guys.


If Chris Mara was half that competent I'd say nepotism be damned lol. Same goes for guys like Stephen Jones. The problem is that we got unlucky that our nepotism involves idiots who would've been fired years ago if they weren't family members.",21946.0,neutral

1p1c5k8,1763571255.0,2135,0.96,174,Discussion,"$151.9M for our defense.  The problem is most NFL teams build a defense that pairs well with an explosive offense. When you're able to score on any given drive, teams are forced to pass more to keep up which makes pass rushers invaluable. The problem is that pass rushers in today's NFL who can also defend the run well are so rare, so those highly paid edge guys now become a liability when the team goes down early and the opponents can run all over us (30th in yards, 32nd in Y/A).


This season is obviously a wash but I could see this defense and making a huge turnaround next year if our offense with Dart, Leek and Skat coming back healthy can play to their potential and put together a top-10ish offense. Obviously we will also need to find a better coordinator than Bowen (low bar) and hopefully add a few mid-level vets in the secondary who can give us consistent if not spectacular results.",358680.0,negative

Just so much easier for an offense to be able to function to its full capacity when you are in shorter yard situations and you can keep the defense on its heels because everything is on the table. Didnt even seem like scheme-wise we were doing anything crazy but because we were putting our guys in advantageous positions they have been able to make plays consistently (not perfect of course but still)

Unfortunately there is absolutely no evidence the Giants can find that coach. They have never even interviewed one of these young coaches who went on to be a star. McVay, Shanny, etc. 

They’ve also let multiple coordinators in their building who eventually became huge HC stars get away. Vince Lombardi, Tom Landry, Bill Belichick, Sean Payton, John Fox. All Giants coordinators who went on to success elsewhere as head coaches. All of them won at least one Super Bowl with the exception of Fox, who still managed to take two teams to the Super Bowl. 


I will eventually make peace with hiring Mike McCarthy or some other retread because I think the only way the Giants are likely to hit on a coach who is even remotely competent is to hire someone who we’ve seen do it before. Lower ceiling on that type of hire but also a higher floor, and the Giants have been sitting in the basement for a decade plus now so moving to a higher floor holds a lot of appeal.",1452063.0,neutral

He’s getting the most out of a defense with no picks inside the top 15 of any draft.  

He’s young, fiery and the younger guy is worth the gamble.  I know what Mike McCarthy is, I know what other older coaches bring.  I think the only coaches I’d want with a ton of experience are Tomlin and Harbaugh if the ravens actually let him get away (not happening).

 Sadly we don’t have real journalists reporting on the Giants.  Some are better than others but all are biased clickbait writers that give more opinion and inject their thoughts into articles then actually do old school journalism or reporting just the facts and doing research!

As a fan we need to watch the interviews of the players and coaches ourselves and did through multiple articles to find tidbits of info and piece together the facts ourselves.

Cut off every aspect of fan base.  As long as the money is going in, the owners dont care one bit.  They are still holding on to 87' 90' 07' and 11'  they couldn't care less about our frustration. 

 They rufuse to change the turf.  MSG puts floors over ice for basketball games, which cost 100s of thousands of dollars each week.  The Giants ownership has the money to put in a field that doesn't rob stars of their careers. 

 These goof balls didn't put in a retractable roof in one of the shittiest weather areas for sports.  They did it because Eli was so good at staying upright after getting smashed over and over and he was one of the best throw in the wind Qbs in the league at the time.  We dont owe them anything, but if we want change, we need to starve the ownership until they bow.  

 These players also need to stop living it up like superstars in NYC because they are the NY Giants.  There's a reason Eli backed out of partial ownership. I guarantee he wanted big change and Mara and Tisch told him to kick rocks.  This team is a disgrace and a stain on the leagcy of Giants greats.",327420.0,negative

Can this clown too. My favorite 'defense' of Schoen is how many of his mistakes apparently don't matter because fans approved of it at the time like he's not being paid to have any more insight or understanding than your average redditor or media talking head that has a cursory at best understanding of the teams' needs. 

Schoen's not the worst GM ever, and there are parts of the job he's clearly done well with (Particularly, he hasn't overpaid in a trade like Gettleman often did), but he really hasn't done a very good job. I'm really convinced the only reason people seem to think that this team is so talented is because of the amount of high picks he's made. Very few of his draft picks have outplayed their draft position and he has maybe two meaningful non-draft acquisitions that have been net positives to the team in four years (Burns and Eluemenor).

When Schoen came in I knew there would be hiccups as he learns being a first time GM and a fairly young one at that, but having things like 3 years in a row of roster management issues with the kicker makes it hard for me to have confidence he'll get significantly better. At this point this is his team, and I'm not convinced a coach is the difference between 2 wins and a perennial contender with Schoen at the helm.",81855.0,negative

I’m sure that stupid “what song” contest was sponsored by some business. Big as MetLife or as small as Tony’s Lawn Mower Repair, it was sponsored by some business. That business paid money to have their business mentioned in the capacity that it was mentioned… for the stupid what song contest… Ugh

The folks who are responsible for every ad you see and hear HAVE to make sure they get in every ad that is on their script because those ads are paid for by whoever sponsors the ad. Even if it’s at the absolute wrong time. Seems like the marketing director screwed up with a case of bad timing or had absolutely no other time to do the contest. Nowadays, there’s soooo many corporate sponsors that want their 15 seconds of fame in a stadium full of people. On the NCAA level we’re jam packed with sponsors and ads that have to be presented.

I don't understand why everyone is flipping out over this concussion. This is an important moment in Dart's development. Will he learn from this concussion and change up his running. 

This isn't novel. Everyone has been telling Dart and all QBs this very message. Lamar had to figure out his running style, kept getting hurt. Mahomes started doing some gamesmanship with that side line dance. 

What it means is Giants have a special QB with potential to be the best in the league. The kid can sling it and run TDs in from 20+ yards away. Dual threat.

 Per Google Gemini:

Ben McAdoo is the kind of guy to,

*Tell you, ""Winning is only important when we win"".

*Order two different bowls of soup at a restaurant and mix them together one spoonful at a time.

*Wear a windbreaker tracksuit and stare through the tinted glass at people working out at Curves.

*Watch TV with the volume set to a non-multiple of 5.

*Return VHS tapes to Blockbuster without rewinding.

*Pour his milk before his cereal.

**Get fired and then everyone just kind of forgets about him.**

*Have a ""brutally honest"" team meeting that ends up being the topic of an internet joke.

*Wiggle his fingers and say ""don't mind if I do"" before grabbing a donut.

What else...?",99174.0,neutral

1ox587q,1763155472.0,35828,0.99,84,Meme/Shitpost,"Malik Nabers posted this on his Instagram story😂  In a story done today by ESPN about the fall of Brian Daboll as the Giants head coach, Daboll reportedly exploded on Mike Kafka after their loss to the Eagles last month and threatened to take away his playcalling abilities: ""One player recently told ESPN of Daboll exploding and threatening to take away playcalling from assistant head coach/offensive coordinator Mike Kafka after tight end Theo Johnson dropped a crucial third-down pass downfield against the Eagles.""


It wouldn't have been the first time Daboll had stripped Kafka of his playcalling abilities, as he had done in parts of 2023 and all of 2024. John Mara urged Daboll to give them back to Kafka for 2025. Daboll's temper was a bit of a well-known thing, especially when it came to assistant coaches. The entire drama between Daboll and former defensive coordinator Wink Martindale has been well documented. Daboll also was once seen on the sidelines throwing a tablet at the direction of former QB Daniel Jones following an interception.


Daboll's emotions got the better of him in 2025, as he was fined $100K earlier in the season for attempting to go into the blue medical tent, which really didn't appear to help matters.
Bottom line: Even with the emotional outbursts, Brian Daboll didn't win enough games and didn't show progress as the head coach of the Giants, especially at the end of his tenure and now he is no longer the head coach.


Now with a new mindset and vision this team can only go up from here. I say get Dart another receiver that isn’t short. Dual threat the division and end the Eagles long story drama early as we send them home.",3014926.0,neutral

What a turnaround. 👀  The line has played well but this really highlights how interconnected qb and oline play are. A good qb that doesn't feel phantom pressure and knows how to flow in the pocket can make a below average offensive line look above average. DJ and Russ both would make their first read and if it's not open, panic or run. Often panicking themselves into pressure when there really wasn't pressure. I don't think the line is playing worse for Russ than Dart but they look a lot worse with Russ out there (Obviously Thomas being out the start of the season was a killer but even when Thomas is in there the line does not look the same with Russ).",76058.0,negative

It's not a great line, but it's functional, what they do moving forward is extremely important though.  There is something to build upon and make stronger next offseason.  I'd like to see Eluemunor resigned if Bricillo is kept around.  Eluemunor will probably want to stay if his coach is retained and might want to play the rest of his career with Dart.

Almost as if he was insecure about the question. All he had to answer would've been something normal like ""yeah, it's a new job for sure, but my 25 years of experience in the NFL should help in making the needed adjustments to do a good job as head coach"".

Is it too much to ask for ownership to hire an independent outside agency with a football scouting background to assist with the search? Like somewhere smart with scouting ties to the 49ers, Ravens or Rams. 

Then that team could come up with their best list of candidates, the front office could come up with theirs, and they debate with ownership the best candidates to interview. Then they all write up theirs analyses and recommendations for each candidate and the final list is presented to ownership to decide. Then they repeated the process after they interview the list they came up with. You know, like a competent organization would do. 

I would be completely fine if they followed the processes and came up with someone that I didn’t agree was the best choice. Like an up and coming DC instead of my preferred Offensive mind. But I know it, you know it, the whole world knows it, they won’t do any of that. They will lean on the nepobabies they’ve put in the front office that are somehow Executive Scouts but are part of ownership. With football knowledge akin to a Pop Warner coach and who care more about horse racing than the 3rd round of the NFL draft.

We’ll get Mike McCarthy or someone similarly uninspiring who will go 4-13 and will be let go after a similar second season. In my opinion it doesn’t make any sense and they should just keep trying to find a forward thinker like the next Shanahan or McVay. They need to try and find a way off this dumpster fire coaching carousel.",120240.0,positive

1. This insane narrative of no first time head coaches has to go. I get the reasoning - it hasn't worked out great for us in the past few years. Yet guys like McVey, LaFleur, Campbell and others are proof that when it does work, it works well. Let's be open to that.
2. Be real about those with Head Coaching experience. If someone was a failed head coach more than a decade ago, that shouldn't count against them. Especially if they have been in a productive Coordinator somewhere else since.
3. Quit holding Interim Head Coaching against people. There's a reason the position was open in the first place. You are taking a current coordinator and crowning him as leader of an already failed organization which they have little, if any time to mold to their vision. That just aint fair.
4. Speaking of people with Head Coaching experience. It'd be good to point out why they are currently unemployed. That definitely needs to be part of the discussion - and what they could do to mitigate the same mistakes. 
5. Stop with the Belichek/Saban tree worship. Both of them were great Head Coaches for their respective organizations. However, neither one of them has been great at developing their coaches beyond the position they are hired for. How many fails have come from that tree? Do we really need to add to that list that includes Judge and Daboll?

I'm truly interested in seeing everyone's thoughts on these guidelines. It might be interesting to see how they match, or don't with Schoen's search over the coming months.

 I agree with every point, but with some reservations for 3.

The track record for interims is not good. To be fair, there are very few dat points… but there’s a reason teams rarely take a promote-from-within approach to a team so bad the HC got fired mid season.

I think you’d need to see a really stunning turnaround and have some previously established infatuation to justify an interim hiring.

 What annoys me the most about the “no first time HCs” argument is that, while it hasn’t worked out for us lately, it ignores that most HCs in general don’t work out. There’s only 32 HC jobs and every offseason there’s at least 5-6 openings. It’s a high turnover position, and most of them fail. It’s the same with QBs. Most QBs end up becoming busts. That doesn’t mean you just settle with some mediocre journeyman who has proved he can at least stick around in the league, and the same is true with HCs. Doesn’t mean they can’t grow and improve from their first time as a HC, but idk more often than not it just feels uninspired. Also, just look around the league. Of the 14 teams currently in a playoff spot, only 4 have a retread coach (5 if you want to count Dan Campbell’s interim stint in Miami).",465908.0,neutral

 People are quick to dismiss Kafka from the job beyond the rest of this year, and I get it - anyone associated with our recent FO is covered in an unmistakable stench. But he's a different personality than we've seen at HC.

With that, I have a few ideas or guidelines that I would hope we can all agree on. If not, let's discuss why. 

1. This insane narrative of no first time head coaches has to go. I get the reasoning - it hasn't worked out great for us in the past few years. Yet guys like McVey, LaFleur, Campbell and others are proof that when it does work, it works well. Let's be open to that.
2. Be real about those with Head Coaching experience. If someone was a failed head coach more than a decade ago, that shouldn't count against them. Especially if they have been in a productive Coordinator somewhere else since.
3. Quit holding Interim Head Coaching against people. There's a reason the position was open in the first place. You are taking a current coordinator and crowning him as leader of an already failed organization which they have little, if any time to mold to their vision. That just aint fair.
4. Speaking of people with Head Coaching experience. It'd be good to point out why they are currently unemployed. That definitely needs to be part of the discussion - and what they could do to mitigate the same mistakes. 
5. Stop with the Belichek/Saban tree worship. Both of them were great Head Coaches for their respective organizations. However, neither one of them has been great at developing their coaches beyond the position they are hired for. How many fails have come from that tree? Do we really need to add to that list that includes Judge and Daboll?

I'm truly interested in seeing everyone's thoughts on these guidelines. It might be interesting to see how they match, or don't with Schoen's search over the coming months.

It's like plotting a point in a triangle. You can have 2/3 things but there's not going to be a candidate that fits everything.

 Eh seems like you are chopping the legs out of a lot of people’s ethos on what a good HC candidate is, seems to me most of the stuff you listed are valid reasons people could favor or disregard certain types of candidates 

If you take all these things away I’m  not sure what’s left to debate? Potential scheme? Schemes hard to argue with a lot of these guys as they aren’t the head honcho so when do you know it’s them vs the HC.

 Saban’s coaching tree in college is pretty impressive, but I agree star away from the Belichick tree as they tend to flop in the pros. The next coach can’t be afraid to hire coordinators that might move on to head coaches. If you have the right culture, it should be a little bump. I’m not a big fan of hiring college coaches for their fist job in the pros as the tend to flame out (Saban, Spurrier, Pete Carroll, Klingon Kingsbury) although with the NIL now it might be different",22186.0,neutral

1. This insane narrative of no first time head coaches has to go. I get the reasoning - it hasn't worked out great for us in the past few years. Yet guys like McVey, LaFleur, Campbell and others are proof that when it does work, it works well. Let's be open to that.
2. Be real about those with Head Coaching experience. If someone was a failed head coach more than a decade ago, that shouldn't count against them. Especially if they have been in a productive Coordinator somewhere else since.
3. Quit holding Interim Head Coaching against people. There's a reason the position was open in the first place. You are taking a current coordinator and crowning him as leader of an already failed organization which they have little, if any time to mold to their vision. That just aint fair.
4. Speaking of people with Head Coaching experience. It'd be good to point out why they are currently unemployed. That definitely needs to be part of the discussion - and what they could do to mitigate the same mistakes. 
5. Stop with the Belichek/Saban tree worship. Both of them were great Head Coaches for their respective organizations. However, neither one of them has been great at developing their coaches beyond the position they are hired for. How many fails have come from that tree? Do we really need to add to that list that includes Judge and Daboll?

I'm truly interested in seeing everyone's thoughts on these guidelines. It might be interesting to see how they match, or don't with Schoen's search over the coming months.

 Good points, especially 1 & 2.  I've seen way too much discussion here dismissing anyone who doesn't have head coaching experience and coordinators who had one shot at it and failed years ago.

 Gonna ignore about what you said about being real and headed straight to the top of the tree in #4. 

I'm shooting for the fences going full circle jerk here. 

Billy belichick as head coach and Mike McDaniels as OC.

Bill is not going to do UNC for long, and will probably want to get out. He's always loved the giants organization, and would make sense for him to end his coaching days here, come full circle. Give his girlfriend the nyg job of social media coordinator, who cares. I also think the Maras will tell him no on Lombardi coming too and he will actually listen. 

Be great to have a head coach who is defensive minded, Bill has got that background and history here, so NYG need an offense guy. Mikey McD is probably out at Miami, pull him in as the OC, and NYG are set.

Say what you will of Joe Schoen, he at least had the dignity to not sell the bank and the future to save his job.


Going in to the off-season it cannot be understand how important it will be to ensure the continued success of the line for Dart. Elumenor should be given another 2 year deal in my mind. We need to spend money on 2 plus road graders at guard. That will help us immensely with redzone efficiency. Whatever we do though, we cannot go into next season with Mbow as a slotted starter. He's a great advantage as a swing guard or tackle and if he can win a starting job great but he can't be the default choice at any position going into next year.


After that needs to be interior d line and linebackers. We need plus run defenders if we ever want to be successful with this pass rush we've built.


After that, I'm thinking competition signings. Bring in 2-3 vets at corner, guys who might not be all there physically but aren't so sloppy that they can't be trusted to cover in a pinch. Bring in safety depth to light a fire under Nubens ass.


Lastly, receiver needs a shore up. There's not getting out of Slayton ATM but I think we can toss a short term deal at a mid receiver 2-3 for some production that Wan'dale loses due to his limited size and slot only role.


Whatever route we go though, trenches need to be the focus of this off-season and for the love of God please retain Carmen Bricillo.",19238.0,negative

Add Carter, Skattebo and older Nabers, Thomas to that and it's a very good starting point for a new coach. Bigger names will come available before mid January, that's for sure.

Daboll is responsible for Bowen and Bowen's output.  As he has been for the DC in every year that he's been here.  That's what a HC does.  

Yes, Bowen should have been fired at the end of last year, but I think the larger problem is that none of the true candidates available wanted to work for Daboll!  Just look at Hard Knocks for an example of this.  Daboll is not capable of being a HC in the NFL.

____

***Bears:***

____________

**2012:** 


Bears move on from long-term super bowl making coach Lovie Smith while retaining GM Phil Emery.

**2013:**

Bears hire offensive dynamo Marc Trestman to unlock Jay and the offense. An exciting season with a flawed team ends on a low note, with a blown coverage in week 17 against the Packers keeping the Bears out of the playoffs, but fans leave with optimism for next season.

**2014:**

A disastrous season as Trestman clearly loses control of the team halfway through the season. In an effort to save his job, Trestman benches franchise QB, robbing him of a personal achievement (4000 passing yards). House is cleaned by season's end.

**2015-2016:**

Bears hire old veteran coach John Fox to fix the locker room. Bears are bad and irrelevant, and franchise QB is cut at season's end.

**2017:**

Bears unexpectedly draft new QB Mitch Trubisky and get clowned on. The team still sucks and Fox is fired at season's end.

**2018:**

Bears hire new offensive dynamo Matt Nagy and the team surprises everyone by making the playoffs and almost winning in the wildcard round. Nagy wins coach of the year.

**2019-2020:** 

Bears fall back down to earth with 2 disappointing seasons. Trubisky heavily regresses as calls for Nagy's head grow louder and louder. Trubisky leaves in the offseason.

**2021:** 

Bears don't fire Nagy and draft new QB Justin Fields into a lame duck situation. The team sucks again and the Bears clean house at season's end.

____

***Giants:***

____

**2015:** 

Giants move on from long-term super bowl winning coach Tom Coughlin while retaining GM Jerry Reese.


**2016:** 

Giants hire offensive dynamo Ben McAdoo to unlock Eli and the offense. An exciting season with a flawed team ends on a low note, with a big loss in the wildcard round against the Packers, but fans leave with optimism for next season.


**2017:**

 A disastrous season as McAdoo clearly loses control of the team halfway through the season. In an effort to save his job, McAdoo benches franchise QB, robbing him of a personal achievement (210 consecutive starts). House is cleaned by season's end.


**2018:** 

Giants hire old veteran coach Pat Shurmur to fix the locker room. Giants are bad and irrelevant, and franchise QB retires at next season's end.


**2019:** 

Giants unexpectedly draft new QB Daniel Jones and get clowned on. The team still sucks and Shurmur is fired at season's end.


**2020-2021:**

The Joe Judge era is an outlier and doesn't fit in with the Bears timeline unless you lump it in with Shurmur as rebuilding years.

**2022:**

Giants hire new offensive dynamo Brian Daboll and the team surprises everyone by making the playoffs and defeating the Vikings in the wildcard round. Daboll wins coach of the year.


**2023-2024:**

Giants fall back down to earth with 2 disappointing seasons. Jones heavily regresses as calls for Daboll's head grow louder and louder. Jones is traded in the offseason.

**2025:** 

Giants don't fire Daboll and draft new QB Jaxson Dart into a lame duck situation. The team sucks again and the Giants fire Daboll and likely GM Joe Schoen by season's end.

2024 is not looking great due to player regression in Year 2 but we got Malik (superstar) and Tracy (looked promising but has regressed) and I'm still high on Theo Johnson. Honestly, if you find one superstar in a draft at a key position, it's a win.  

2025 seems good so far with Carter, Skat and Dart. 

He's not terrible at drafting. He's terrible at other things like roster management and overvaluing his own picks - it's beyond time to cut Neal, Hyatt and Banks - and the team has no depth.

Just fire him now. Rip the bandaid.

IMO the only reason not to fire him right now is if you are planning on cleaning house and firing both Schoen and Daboll after the season anyway.

And even then, there is no reason to keep them till the end of the season other than some milquetoast ideal of being “classy”.

There needs to be accountability or the organization is broken at Mara’s door  Commenting this here because I'm not allowed to post in this sub.

The Giants start most of their drives on second and long because this organization lacks a functional analytics staff.

I ran a quick script using publicly available NFL data on a hunch. This is something any freshman at a reputable technical university could do in 15 minutes, but of course we are talking about an ownership group who hired Dave ""I don't believe in those nerds"" Gettlemen at the height of the analytics revolution in pro sports, so nobody in the Giants building is doing even this.  
  
Mike Kafka has a very predictable playcalling tic where he calls a run up the middle on the first play of the drive. The Giants run the ball on the first play of the drive nearly 60% of the time, close to the highest % in the NFL. Keep in mind there are many drives - particularly for a losing team - where you are in obvious passing situations at the end of halves or when you're playing for behind and this percentage is much higher situationally. Keep in mind also that the few teams that run the ball more often tend to be teams that - you know - run the ball well.

Halfway competent defensive coordinators are able to pick up on this tendency and playcall to stop the run, resulting in a league-worst ONE POINT FIVE median yards per play when they run on the first play of the drive. Imagine, you are gaining 1.5 yards per play when you make a certain decision, worst in the league, and you continue to make that decision.

Fire Kafka, fire all the nepo babies in the organization. Hell maybe even basic analytics function might help the team's scouting instead of just picking whoever Chris Mara got a crush on when he hung out at the senior bowl for two hours.",147533.0,negative

As soon as they kept them and let them draft their QB, I wanted them to keep the stability for Dart. I didn't and don't want Dart to get stuck with the same situation as Jones did. 

However, at this point I cannot trust this coaching staff to protect Dart from himself. Dart's been banged up in every single game he's played. He's 6'2"" 223 and they're letting him play out there like he's Josh Allen's 6'5"" 237+. The fact that he got hurt, the Bears had a 4:31 drive, and then came in for one snap before getting pulled (Presumably by the independent evaluators) is about as close to a confirmation as I'll get for feeling he got concussed at the end of last game too. 

I get this staff doesn't want to coach away his fire. He's a competitor and we all love that. But for all the good Dart's done this season he isn't helping either being hobbled or on the sideline at crucial parts of the games. 

There are plenty of other reasons to fire this coaching staff, but at this point the one reason I could see to keep them (Dart's development) is entire invalid at this point if he's just going to keep getting hurt with their coaching. It's not just this play, it's the fact that him getting hurt has been a constant.",55325.0,negative

1orvdbv,1762625003.0,847,0.85,113,Videos,"Tiki States one of Major Problems With Giants is That Daboll is not a Winner  It's definitely plausible. My argument against this would be... for the 'most part' we've never really seen an OC turned HC have success without an elite DC. And we really don't often see it the other way either. Josh McDaniels is clearly an elite QB developer, Brady had already been a winner sure when he arrived. But prior to 2006 when McDaniels got there, Brady had 16 game averages of 3600/25/13. In the 5 years following 4113/34/9 and in that span won his first 2 MVPs, 2 OPOY, 4 PBs  and a CPOY. 

People say he's a bad HC, but he really never had much of a chance. His only solid DC he ever had was MIke Nolan his first year in Denver and the team went 8-8. Then Nolan got fired, Wink got hired, they sucked ass and everyone got dropped. 

Hell, even Belichick in Cleveland had pretty shit offensive guys. It wasn't until coming to New England and getting lucky to land Charlie Weis. The Jets had the 4th most yards and 5th most points under Weis in 1998, in 99 they slid to 19th in points, but it was after Testeverde got injured in Week 1 and they had to roll out a bunch of random no names at QB. Otherwise, he was a pretty elite OC in his time. And then he went to McDaniels in 2006. After taking a big step back in 2005 when Belichick took on playcalling duties himself and didn't hire an OC. Look at just about any successful OC and they had a very good DC. 

So I just disagree with the notion that you can see the offense is humming but he's a bad coach because the defense isn't... he needs to be able to rely on his DC to pull his own weight. But it seems like Bowen just gets all down in the dumps like fucking Eeyore and calls the same garbage defenses every week. 

Daboll said there might be scheme changes moving forward, so I do wonder if Daboll finally is stepping in and realizing he clearly can't rely on Bowen. Too little to late probably? But who knows, if they somehow come out this week and the defense is flying all over the place and Caleb looks lost? Maybe his issue is that he's just too loyal to guys more so than he's a bad coach. He does seem to have a pretty long track record in his 4 years here of giving guys a very long leash before giving up on them. At least when he can see they clearly want it.",82074.0,positive

 When I was 8 the Giants had just won XXV. For my birthday party we had a pool party at the Holiday Inn in medford. The night of my party OJ was doing a signing there. We went back for the signing. OJ heard I was the kid whose birthday was on the plaque out front and took that XXI ring off and put it on me and we took a picture.

The Waltons are the richest NFL owners, something to keep in mind when comparing us to Denver if costs are involved.

The other thing these complaints seem to ignore is Metlife is shared between two franchises. Any change has to be signed off by both the Giants and Jets. It also results in the field getting twice as much wear and tear compared to every other stadium except SoFi, which is located in a better climate for managing grass year round.

The turf was literally replaced 3 years ago and it's the same stuff that the Patriots, Lions, Seahawks, and Falcons use and from what I understand, more teams have adopted the same turf. There are articles talking to Giants and Jets players about how much more they like this field over what we used to have and injuries have gone down considerably since we changed it. If you were willing to take a whole 30 seconds to research this, you wouldn't be spreading this bullshit.

On top of that, the stadium that has the most injuries isn't MetLife or even a turf field at all, it's the Arizona Cardinals field which is grass. The turf is literally just a scapegoat for people who want to act like Mara is being cheap when anyone who is paying attention can see he's tried to make it safer.

As if all of that wasn't enough, you guys must not remember the early 2000's when the Giants and Jets DID play on grass. They changed the trays weekly but it turns out, when two teams play on a grass field it's just this side of impossible to keep a good playing surface. There used to be all sorts of complaints about it being uneven or turning into a mud hole. There's no way to please everyone, fans are going to complain no matter what but can we at least stop being lazy and acknowledge the facts about this field?",156642.0,neutral

And that's just fine with Winston. He could easily have complained or been unhappy about his role. Winston has started 87 games in his career and is the NFL's most accomplished current third-string quarterback by a wide margin.

""They stay late with Jaxson, watch tape together, all three of them. Give good input. I think they're a good resource for a young quarterback.""

And that's just fine with Winston. He could easily have complained or been unhappy about his role. Winston has started 87 games in his career and is the NFL's most accomplished current third-string quarterback by a wide margin.

All this has only validated the Giants' desire to have him as their backup to Dart next year.

""That never was mentioned to me, but I'm doing whatever is required from any organization that has me on their roster,"" Winston said. ""I would love to help the young buck turn into the superstar that he is. That's God-given. I would love to assist in any way. But my dream is to be a Super Bowl-winning quarterback in the NFL. In New York, that would be iconic and legendary. Whatever that takes, I'm going to do that."" With how Russ has taken being benched I wouldn't mind keeping him as a backup too to help dart. I don't think he is getting a starting job any time soon.",28365.0,neutral
1or0eyk,1762536551.0,12276,0.81,149,Free Agency / Draft,"2026 Mock Draft because I'm over this season I tried to draft a little differently than most mock drafts I've seen for the Giants to make it more interesting. I don't watch film but I try to watch as many college games as I can so that's where most of these players are coming from.

1st Round: WR Jordyn Tyson - Wan'Dale has taken a step up since Nabers got injured, but the rest of our receiving core just can't seem to hold on to the ball. Tyson can come in and be an immediate WR 2 and a potentially reliable #1 option if Nabers gets hurt again.

2nd Round: OG Gennings Dunker - I believe Dunker will be playing guard at the next level. I'm honestly not sure why people keep mocking tackles high to the Giants since Thomas is elite when healthy and Eluemunor has looked pretty good. Dunker could be an immediate starter at right guard, opening up our running game for when Skattebo comes back.

4th Round: S Zakee Wheatley - Penn State has not looked very good but Wheatley is a bright spot on that defense. With no third round pick, the Giants are gonna be looking for high upside players and rotational depth. Wheatley could come in and compete with Nubin for the starting job at SS. He could also be a rotational piece for the secondary.

5th Round: OC Brian Parker II - I don't expect Parker to be available at 145, but he would be an absolute steal in the fifth if he is. Like Dunker, Parker is going to be a tackle turned interior lineman in the NFL. I have the Giants drafting him to play center but he could also compete alongside Dunker for a guard position. The IOL is in desperate need of depth and Parker could be one of the rare late round picks that develop into a starter.

6th Round: TE Tanner Koziol - Koziol is an under-the-radar prospect that I think deserves more hype. Koziol is one of the few TE prospects that shows promise as both a pass-catcher and a run-blocker. He could serve as sixth offensive lineman on designed runs and also a big body red zone target for Dart to chuck the ball up to. I don't view him getting meaningful reps ahead of Johnson or Bellinger, but he will thrive in the right scheme.

6th Round: LB Jacob Rodriguez - Similar to Koziol, Rodriguez is purely a depth guy that will get on the field for designed options. With McFadden hitting free agency, the Giants should try to target at least one linebacker in this draft and they end up getting the guy who led the Big 12 in tackles last year.

6th Round: K Dominic Zvada - Realistically, the Giants would probably trade down to draft a kicker instead of taking one here. Gano is contracted on the team for one more year, but seeing how god awful our kick game is without Gano might scare the front office enough to draft one here. Zvada is the consensus best kicker in this draft and could provide the Giants some relief in knowing they don't have to worry about their kick game. I like attacking the offensive line, despite what some people think the best weapon for an offense is a dominant offensive line. We’ve finally got ours to be average or a little above average, let’s make it elite and elevate our passing and running game. We can pass block right now but our run blocking leaves a lot to be desired (mostly because our IOL needs work)",1491534.0,neutral

I respect the vision to an extent, but going through another draft and punting on LB(drafting late as a need/depth) again will just lead to this defense being ass against the run for the 4th year in a row.

The room needs to be rebuilt. Okereke is old, Micah is glass, and Muasau is ass.

1or0eyk,1762540488.0,396,0.81,149,Free Agency / Draft,"2026 Mock Draft because I'm over this season I tried to draft a little differently than most mock drafts I've seen for the Giants to make it more interesting. I don't watch film but I try to watch as many college games as I can so that's where most of these players are coming from.

1st Round: WR Jordyn Tyson - Wan'Dale has taken a step up since Nabers got injured, but the rest of our receiving core just can't seem to hold on to the ball. Tyson can come in and be an immediate WR 2 and a potentially reliable #1 option if Nabers gets hurt again.

2nd Round: OG Gennings Dunker - I believe Dunker will be playing guard at the next level. I'm honestly not sure why people keep mocking tackles high to the Giants since Thomas is elite when healthy and Eluemunor has looked pretty good. Dunker could be an immediate starter at right guard, opening up our running game for when Skattebo comes back.

4th Round: S Zakee Wheatley - Penn State has not looked very good but Wheatley is a bright spot on that defense. With no third round pick, the Giants are gonna be looking for high upside players and rotational depth. Wheatley could come in and compete with Nubin for the starting job at SS. He could also be a rotational piece for the secondary.

5th Round: OC Brian Parker II - I don't expect Parker to be available at 145, but he would be an absolute steal in the fifth if he is. Like Dunker, Parker is going to be a tackle turned interior lineman in the NFL. I have the Giants drafting him to play center but he could also compete alongside Dunker for a guard position. The IOL is in desperate need of depth and Parker could be one of the rare late round picks that develop into a starter.

6th Round: TE Tanner Koziol - Koziol is an under-the-radar prospect that I think deserves more hype. Koziol is one of the few TE prospects that shows promise as both a pass-catcher and a run-blocker. He could serve as sixth offensive lineman on designed runs and also a big body red zone target for Dart to chuck the ball up to. I don't view him getting meaningful reps ahead of Johnson or Bellinger, but he will thrive in the right scheme.

6th Round: LB Jacob Rodriguez - Similar to Koziol, Rodriguez is purely a depth guy that will get on the field for designed options. With McFadden hitting free agency, the Giants should try to target at least one linebacker in this draft and they end up getting the guy who led the Big 12 in tackles last year.

6th Round: K Dominic Zvada - Realistically, the Giants would probably trade down to draft a kicker instead of taking one here. Gano is contracted on the team for one more year, but seeing how god awful our kick game is without Gano might scare the front office enough to draft one here.

1. Getting out of bed.
2. Getting into bed.

4. Getting something out of the cabinet.
5. Picking something up off tge floor
6. Getting into hus car
7. Turning your head to respond after you hear your name called.

1oqc6by,1762468162.0,11277,0.89,233,Discussion,"A Look at HC Candidates Hello Big Blue. You may have seen me discussing this in multiple discussion threads here the last few days, so I figured I would make a lengthy post about it. I have gone down the rabbit-hole quite a bit on potential HC and GM candidates this upcoming offseason, and I wanted to run some candidates by everyone to familiarize ourselves and see what everyone thinks. Let me know if you would also be interested in a GM post. That being said, let's get underway! 

  
**First things first:** In my mind, all bets are off if either **John Harbaugh** or **Mike Tomlin** gets canned. They are not without their flaws, but those are the exact kind of experienced leaders that you want with your team. That being said, let's start for real. 

  
***Former Head Coaches***

Here I will begin with some guys who have had the head job before. I truly do think that these may be the guys we look at the strongest, and that could be the best move. Of course, they all have been fired for a reason lol.

**Mike McCarthy - former Cowboys and Packers HC**

Of course everyone knows McCarthy. We interviewed him in the past. Sure, heads may roll, but his resume is certainly good, and he might be the ""Tom Thibodeau"" type hire that we need.

**Kliff Kingsbury - Commanders OC**

He's had his ups and downs, mainly as seasons go on. I do believe though, that he is a bright offensive mind and the type of guy that would mesh well in Dart and this young core. I also have a sense he has learned from his mistakes in Arizona while learning from a season coach in Dan Quinn.

**Kevin Stefanski - Browns HC**

Currently the Browns HC, it's looking like Stefanski's days may be numbered. Tbh though, I think he had done a great job in Cleveland, maximizing a lot of the potential there. I mean, it's a losing job, and he has given them the most success they've seen in ages. A change of scenery could be what he needs. He also had some success in Minnesota with Pat Shurmur (yikes).

**Mike McDaniel - Dolphins HC**

Not going to say too much here. I still think he is a good offensive mind. He had a pretty bad team these past two years. Could be worth a look, but may ultimately be a better OC. 

**Steve Spagnuolo - Chiefs DC**

I know he's older and people may not want a guy with ties to the team, but he's legit one of the best defensive minds in the league. Loved by players and the organization, and they seem to love him. Call me crazy, ik his HC tenure was a bust, but I think he should be considered.

**Robert Saleh - 49ers DC**

Didn't do a terrible job with the Jets. He's familiar with the market and still seems to be a good coordinator. Also had good things to say about Dart. Maybe a consideration.

  
***Offensive Minded Options***

Getting into some first-time HC options, these are in no particular order. An offensive-minded HC could always be a good option, and it's essential to help Dart out. Look at what Ben Johnson has done in Chicago.

**Joe Brady - Bills OC**

I know another Bills guy may turn people away, but Brady has been loved by his players and has arguably done a better job than Daboll in Buffalo. Also a big part in success for the Saints and LSU. Sure to be one of the most frequently mentioned names around the league this offseason.

**Klint Kubiak - Seahawks OC**

Kubiak's name is heating up for good reason. He has done a spectacular job in Seattle with Darnold and that young core, and was also very productive for a bad Saints team. One of my top choices and feels like a matter of time before he becomes a HC.

**Mike Lafleur - Rams OC**

Just a really big fan of the Rams organization. One of the best run teams and the McVay tree is filled with bright minds. Lafleur is of course related to Packers HC Matt.

**Aubrey Pleasant - Rams Passing Game Coordinator**

See above. Pleasant also has knowledge on the defensive side of things, overseeing the Rams passing game through both lenses. McVay let him coach preseason games twice as well.

**Adam Stenavich - Packers OC**

Another really successful organization. Stenavich has been around the league for some time now, and even was in Michigan shortly. While not the playcaller, he has put together some really successful offenses in GB and helped to develop a talented young group.

  
***Defensive Minded Options***

Seeing as Dart has developed ahead of schedule, I think the door may be a little more open for a defensive HC, as long as he hires a good OC. Some good options here as well.

**Jesse Minter - Chargers DC**

A hot name in coaching circles. Jesse Minter has led a very successful Chargers defense and Michigan defense before that. He has learned from both the Harbaugh brothers and is a bright, young mind that is sure to be a HC some day soon.

**Jeff Hafley - Packers DC**

Another Packers coordinator. Hafley is over-qualified for the DC spot in GB, having been HC at Boston College previously, and finding success there as well. GB has had a talented defense the past 2 years, and Hafley deserves a lot of credit.

**Lou Anarumo - Colts DC**

Anarumo may not be a name that jumps to mind, but I think he deserves a mention. Did a lot of good in Cincinnati (who's defense has certainly got worse since he's left) and is part of a very successful Colts team this season. Defense has plagued us for years, and maybe this can finally be the move to solidify things, especially given all the talent we have. 

**Chris Shula - Rams DC**

Comes from a family of football. Shula has helped to rebuild this Rams defense post-Aaron Donald and seems to be a highly respected name around the league

***Wild Card Mention***

**Lane Kiffin - Ole Miss HC**

I don't think that this will happen, and I don't think it's a particularly good idea, but I DO think it deserves a mention. Probably the only college HC that we could consider, and I actually could see him taking the job. Still very unlikely imo.

**Before you say anything:** No **Jon Gruden** is not happening. Neither is **Bill Belichick** or **Brian Flores**.

  
So yeah! That's my list. Let me know what you all think and if there's any other names I should be aware of. Apologies for the lengthy post, I'm desperate over here lol. Go Big Blue! My wish list is somebody who knows how to manage a whole team. I can't stomach someone who has no answers for one side of the ball.",2348548.0,neutral

Let me know if you would also be interested in a GM post. That being said, let's get underway! 

  
**First things first:** In my mind, all bets are off if either **John Harbaugh** or **Mike Tomlin** gets canned. They are not without their flaws, but those are the exact kind of experienced leaders that you want with your team. That being said, let's start for real. 

  
***Former Head Coaches***

Here I will begin with some guys who have had the head job before. I truly do think that these may be the guys we look at the strongest, and that could be the best move. Of course, they all have been fired for a reason lol.

**Mike McCarthy - former Cowboys and Packers HC**

Of course everyone knows McCarthy. We interviewed him in the past. Sure, heads may roll, but his resume is certainly good, and he might be the ""Tom Thibodeau"" type hire that we need.

**Kliff Kingsbury - Commanders OC**

He's had his ups and downs, mainly as seasons go on. I do believe though, that he is a bright offensive mind and the type of guy that would mesh well in Dart and this young core. I also have a sense he has learned from his mistakes in Arizona while learning from a season coach in Dan Quinn.

**Kevin Stefanski - Browns HC**

Currently the Browns HC, it's looking like Stefanski's days may be numbered. Tbh though, I think he had done a great job in Cleveland, maximizing a lot of the potential there. I mean, it's a losing job, and he has given them the most success they've seen in ages. A change of scenery could be what he needs. He also had some success in Minnesota with Pat Shurmur (yikes).

**Mike McDaniel - Dolphins HC**

Not going to say too much here. I still think he is a good offensive mind. He had a pretty bad team these past two years. Could be worth a look, but may ultimately be a better OC. 

**Steve Spagnuolo - Chiefs DC**

I know he's older and people may not want a guy with ties to the team, but he's legit one of the best defensive minds in the league. Loved by players and the organization, and they seem to love him. Call me crazy, ik his HC tenure was a bust, but I think he should be considered.

**Robert Saleh - 49ers DC**

Didn't do a terrible job with the Jets. He's familiar with the market and still seems to be a good coordinator. Also had good things to say about Dart. Maybe a consideration.

  
***Offensive Minded Options***

Getting into some first-time HC options, these are in no particular order. An offensive-minded HC could always be a good option, and it's essential to help Dart out. Look at what Ben Johnson has done in Chicago.

**Joe Brady - Bills OC**

I know another Bills guy may turn people away, but Brady has been loved by his players and has arguably done a better job than Daboll in Buffalo. Also a big part in success for the Saints and LSU. Sure to be one of the most frequently mentioned names around the league this offseason.

**Klint Kubiak - Seahawks OC**

Kubiak's name is heating up for good reason. He has done a spectacular job in Seattle with Darnold and that young core, and was also very productive for a bad Saints team. One of my top choices and feels like a matter of time before he becomes a HC.

**Mike Lafleur - Rams OC**

Just a really big fan of the Rams organization. One of the best run teams and the McVay tree is filled with bright minds. Lafleur is of course related to Packers HC Matt.

**Aubrey Pleasant - Rams Passing Game Coordinator**

See above. Pleasant also has knowledge on the defensive side of things, overseeing the Rams passing game through both lenses. McVay let him coach preseason games twice as well.

**Adam Stenavich - Packers OC**

Another really successful organization. Stenavich has been around the league for some time now, and even was in Michigan shortly. While not the playcaller, he has put together some really successful offenses in GB and helped to develop a talented young group.

  
***Defensive Minded Options***

Seeing as Dart has developed ahead of schedule, I think the door may be a little more open for a defensive HC, as long as he hires a good OC. Some good options here as well.

**Jesse Minter - Chargers DC**

A hot name in coaching circles. Jesse Minter has led a very successful Chargers defense and Michigan defense before that. He has learned from both the Harbaugh brothers and is a bright, young mind that is sure to be a HC some day soon.

**Jeff Hafley - Packers DC**

Another Packers coordinator. Hafley is over-qualified for the DC spot in GB, having been HC at Boston College previously, and finding success there as well. GB has had a talented defense the past 2 years, and Hafley deserves a lot of credit.

**Lou Anarumo - Colts DC**

Anarumo may not be a name that jumps to mind, but I think he deserves a mention. Did a lot of good in Cincinnati (who's defense has certainly got worse since he's left) and is part of a very successful Colts team this season. Defense has plagued us for years, and maybe this can finally be the move to solidify things, especially given all the talent we have. 

**Chris Shula - Rams DC**

Comes from a family of football. Shula has helped to rebuild this Rams defense post-Aaron Donald and seems to be a highly respected name around the league

***Wild Card Mention***

**Lane Kiffin - Ole Miss HC**

I don't think that this will happen, and I don't think it's a particularly good idea, but I DO think it deserves a mention. Probably the only college HC that we could consider, and I actually could see him taking the job. Still very unlikely imo.

**Before you say anything:** No **Jon Gruden** is not happening. Neither is **Bill Belichick** or **Brian Flores**.

  
So yeah! That's my list. Let me know what you all think and if there's any other names I should be aware of. Apologies for the lengthy post, I'm desperate over here lol. Go Big Blue! First timers: Lafleur or Klint


Run it back: Saleh (only if he can get McDaniel to run offense)

Won’t cry about it but: McCarthy


No: Spags, McDaniel, Kliff, Brady, Minter, Lane

I honestly wouldn’t mind Robert Saleh.  Say what you want about his exit with the Jets but he had that defense playing hard for him every snap.  

Plus we have the quarterback that covers the offensive problems that plagued his tenure.  Even than dude went 7-10 with Zach fucking Wilson.  We’d be ecstatic with a 7 win season at this point.",1491142.0,negative

Let me know if you would also be interested in a GM post. That being said, let's get underway! 

  
**First things first:** In my mind, all bets are off if either **John Harbaugh** or **Mike Tomlin** gets canned. They are not without their flaws, but those are the exact kind of experienced leaders that you want with your team. That being said, let's start for real. 

  
***Former Head Coaches***

Here I will begin with some guys who have had the head job before. I truly do think that these may be the guys we look at the strongest, and that could be the best move. Of course, they all have been fired for a reason lol.

**Mike McCarthy - former Cowboys and Packers HC**

Of course everyone knows McCarthy. We interviewed him in the past. Sure, heads may roll, but his resume is certainly good, and he might be the ""Tom Thibodeau"" type hire that we need.

**Kliff Kingsbury - Commanders OC**

He's had his ups and downs, mainly as seasons go on. I do believe though, that he is a bright offensive mind and the type of guy that would mesh well in Dart and this young core. I also have a sense he has learned from his mistakes in Arizona while learning from a season coach in Dan Quinn.

**Kevin Stefanski - Browns HC**

Currently the Browns HC, it's looking like Stefanski's days may be numbered. Tbh though, I think he had done a great job in Cleveland, maximizing a lot of the potential there. I mean, it's a losing job, and he has given them the most success they've seen in ages. A change of scenery could be what he needs. He also had some success in Minnesota with Pat Shurmur (yikes).

**Mike McDaniel - Dolphins HC**

Not going to say too much here. I still think he is a good offensive mind. He had a pretty bad team these past two years. Could be worth a look, but may ultimately be a better OC. 

**Steve Spagnuolo - Chiefs DC**

I know he's older and people may not want a guy with ties to the team, but he's legit one of the best defensive minds in the league. Loved by players and the organization, and they seem to love him. Call me crazy, ik his HC tenure was a bust, but I think he should be considered.

**Robert Saleh - 49ers DC**

Didn't do a terrible job with the Jets. He's familiar with the market and still seems to be a good coordinator. Also had good things to say about Dart. Maybe a consideration.

  
***Offensive Minded Options***

Getting into some first-time HC options, these are in no particular order. An offensive-minded HC could always be a good option, and it's essential to help Dart out. Look at what Ben Johnson has done in Chicago.

**Joe Brady - Bills OC**

I know another Bills guy may turn people away, but Brady has been loved by his players and has arguably done a better job than Daboll in Buffalo. Also a big part in success for the Saints and LSU. Sure to be one of the most frequently mentioned names around the league this offseason.

**Klint Kubiak - Seahawks OC**

Kubiak's name is heating up for good reason. He has done a spectacular job in Seattle with Darnold and that young core, and was also very productive for a bad Saints team. One of my top choices and feels like a matter of time before he becomes a HC.

**Mike Lafleur - Rams OC**

Just a really big fan of the Rams organization. One of the best run teams and the McVay tree is filled with bright minds. Lafleur is of course related to Packers HC Matt.

**Aubrey Pleasant - Rams Passing Game Coordinator**

See above. Pleasant also has knowledge on the defensive side of things, overseeing the Rams passing game through both lenses. McVay let him coach preseason games twice as well.

**Adam Stenavich - Packers OC**

Another really successful organization. Stenavich has been around the league for some time now, and even was in Michigan shortly. While not the playcaller, he has put together some really successful offenses in GB and helped to develop a talented young group.

  
***Defensive Minded Options***

Seeing as Dart has developed ahead of schedule, I think the door may be a little more open for a defensive HC, as long as he hires a good OC. Some good options here as well.

**Jesse Minter - Chargers DC**

A hot name in coaching circles. Jesse Minter has led a very successful Chargers defense and Michigan defense before that. He has learned from both the Harbaugh brothers and is a bright, young mind that is sure to be a HC some day soon.

**Jeff Hafley - Packers DC**

Another Packers coordinator. Hafley is over-qualified for the DC spot in GB, having been HC at Boston College previously, and finding success there as well. GB has had a talented defense the past 2 years, and Hafley deserves a lot of credit.

**Lou Anarumo - Colts DC**

Anarumo may not be a name that jumps to mind, but I think he deserves a mention. Did a lot of good in Cincinnati (who's defense has certainly got worse since he's left) and is part of a very successful Colts team this season. Defense has plagued us for years, and maybe this can finally be the move to solidify things, especially given all the talent we have. 

**Chris Shula - Rams DC**

Comes from a family of football. Shula has helped to rebuild this Rams defense post-Aaron Donald and seems to be a highly respected name around the league

***Wild Card Mention***

**Lane Kiffin - Ole Miss HC**

I don't think that this will happen, and I don't think it's a particularly good idea, but I DO think it deserves a mention. Probably the only college HC that we could consider, and I actually could see him taking the job. Still very unlikely imo.

**Before you say anything:** No **Jon Gruden** is not happening. Neither is **Bill Belichick** or **Brian Flores**.

  
So yeah! That's my list. Let me know what you all think and if there's any other names I should be aware of. Apologies for the lengthy post, I'm desperate over here lol. Go Big Blue! Just not kiffin plz",223671.0,neutral

I thought there were no reasonable options until I saw this list. Some good options, but one I would stay away from is McCarthy. I agree with no Gruden, Belichick and Flores. Heck I think Flores still has a lawsuit pending against the Giants. He would straighten some players out though.

There are some that should just be coordinators. Such as McDaniels.",223671.0,positive

**First things first:** In my mind, all bets are off if either **John Harbaugh** or **Mike Tomlin** gets canned. They are not without their flaws, but those are the exact kind of experienced leaders that you want with your team. That being said, let's start for real. 

  
***Former Head Coaches***

Here I will begin with some guys who have had the head job before. I truly do think that these may be the guys we look at the strongest, and that could be the best move. Of course, they all have been fired for a reason lol.

**Mike McCarthy - former Cowboys and Packers HC**

Of course everyone knows McCarthy. We interviewed him in the past. Sure, heads may roll, but his resume is certainly good, and he might be the ""Tom Thibodeau"" type hire that we need.

**Kliff Kingsbury - Commanders OC**

He's had his ups and downs, mainly as seasons go on. I do believe though, that he is a bright offensive mind and the type of guy that would mesh well in Dart and this young core. I also have a sense he has learned from his mistakes in Arizona while learning from a season coach in Dan Quinn.

**Kevin Stefanski - Browns HC**

Currently the Browns HC, it's looking like Stefanski's days may be numbered. Tbh though, I think he had done a great job in Cleveland, maximizing a lot of the potential there. I mean, it's a losing job, and he has given them the most success they've seen in ages. A change of scenery could be what he needs. He also had some success in Minnesota with Pat Shurmur (yikes).

**Mike McDaniel - Dolphins HC**

Not going to say too much here. I still think he is a good offensive mind. He had a pretty bad team these past two years. Could be worth a look, but may ultimately be a better OC. 

**Steve Spagnuolo - Chiefs DC**

I know he's older and people may not want a guy with ties to the team, but he's legit one of the best defensive minds in the league. Loved by players and the organization, and they seem to love him. Call me crazy, ik his HC tenure was a bust, but I think he should be considered.

**Robert Saleh - 49ers DC**

Didn't do a terrible job with the Jets. He's familiar with the market and still seems to be a good coordinator. Also had good things to say about Dart. Maybe a consideration.

  
***Offensive Minded Options***

Getting into some first-time HC options, these are in no particular order. An offensive-minded HC could always be a good option, and it's essential to help Dart out. Look at what Ben Johnson has done in Chicago.

**Joe Brady - Bills OC**

I know another Bills guy may turn people away, but Brady has been loved by his players and has arguably done a better job than Daboll in Buffalo. Also a big part in success for the Saints and LSU. Sure to be one of the most frequently mentioned names around the league this offseason.

**Klint Kubiak - Seahawks OC**

Kubiak's name is heating up for good reason. He has done a spectacular job in Seattle with Darnold and that young core, and was also very productive for a bad Saints team. One of my top choices and feels like a matter of time before he becomes a HC.

**Mike Lafleur - Rams OC**

Just a really big fan of the Rams organization. One of the best run teams and the McVay tree is filled with bright minds. Lafleur is of course related to Packers HC Matt.

**Aubrey Pleasant - Rams Passing Game Coordinator**

See above. Pleasant also has knowledge on the defensive side of things, overseeing the Rams passing game through both lenses. McVay let him coach preseason games twice as well.

**Adam Stenavich - Packers OC**

Another really successful organization. Stenavich has been around the league for some time now, and even was in Michigan shortly. While not the playcaller, he has put together some really successful offenses in GB and helped to develop a talented young group.

  
***Defensive Minded Options***

Seeing as Dart has developed ahead of schedule, I think the door may be a little more open for a defensive HC, as long as he hires a good OC. Some good options here as well.

**Jesse Minter - Chargers DC**

A hot name in coaching circles. Jesse Minter has led a very successful Chargers defense and Michigan defense before that. He has learned from both the Harbaugh brothers and is a bright, young mind that is sure to be a HC some day soon.

**Jeff Hafley - Packers DC**

Another Packers coordinator. Hafley is over-qualified for the DC spot in GB, having been HC at Boston College previously, and finding success there as well. GB has had a talented defense the past 2 years, and Hafley deserves a lot of credit.

**Lou Anarumo - Colts DC**

Anarumo may not be a name that jumps to mind, but I think he deserves a mention. Did a lot of good in Cincinnati (who's defense has certainly got worse since he's left) and is part of a very successful Colts team this season. Defense has plagued us for years, and maybe this can finally be the move to solidify things, especially given all the talent we have. 

**Chris Shula - Rams DC**

Comes from a family of football. Shula has helped to rebuild this Rams defense post-Aaron Donald and seems to be a highly respected name around the league

***Wild Card Mention***

**Lane Kiffin - Ole Miss HC**

I don't think that this will happen, and I don't think it's a particularly good idea, but I DO think it deserves a mention. Probably the only college HC that we could consider, and I actually could see him taking the job. Still very unlikely imo.

**Before you say anything:** No **Jon Gruden** is not happening. Neither is **Bill Belichick** or **Brian Flores**.

  
So yeah! That's my list. Let me know what you all think and if there's any other names I should be aware of. Apologies for the lengthy post, I'm desperate over here lol. Go Big Blue! A defensive minded coach who will retain Kafka is the way",372785.0,positive

Suppose the latter two would be the best bet but it would still be a bet that they learned from their mistakes. That said I think the only move is to get a McCarthy type warts and all.

Here I will begin with some guys who have had the head job before. I truly do think that these may be the guys we look at the strongest, and that could be the best move. Of course, they all have been fired for a reason lol.

**Mike McCarthy - former Cowboys and Packers HC**

Of course everyone knows McCarthy. We interviewed him in the past. Sure, heads may roll, but his resume is certainly good, and he might be the ""Tom Thibodeau"" type hire that we need.

**Kliff Kingsbury - Commanders OC**

He's had his ups and downs, mainly as seasons go on. I do believe though, that he is a bright offensive mind and the type of guy that would mesh well in Dart and this young core. I also have a sense he has learned from his mistakes in Arizona while learning from a season coach in Dan Quinn.

**Kevin Stefanski - Browns HC**

Currently the Browns HC, it's looking like Stefanski's days may be numbered. Tbh though, I think he had done a great job in Cleveland, maximizing a lot of the potential there. I mean, it's a losing job, and he has given them the most success they've seen in ages. A change of scenery could be what he needs. He also had some success in Minnesota with Pat Shurmur (yikes).

**Mike McDaniel - Dolphins HC**

Not going to say too much here. I still think he is a good offensive mind. He had a pretty bad team these past two years. Could be worth a look, but may ultimately be a better OC. 

**Steve Spagnuolo - Chiefs DC**

I know he's older and people may not want a guy with ties to the team, but he's legit one of the best defensive minds in the league. Loved by players and the organization, and they seem to love him. Call me crazy, ik his HC tenure was a bust, but I think he should be considered.

**Robert Saleh - 49ers DC**

Didn't do a terrible job with the Jets. He's familiar with the market and still seems to be a good coordinator. Also had good things to say about Dart. Maybe a consideration.

  
***Offensive Minded Options***

Getting into some first-time HC options, these are in no particular order. An offensive-minded HC could always be a good option, and it's essential to help Dart out. Look at what Ben Johnson has done in Chicago.

**Joe Brady - Bills OC**

I know another Bills guy may turn people away, but Brady has been loved by his players and has arguably done a better job than Daboll in Buffalo. Also a big part in success for the Saints and LSU. Sure to be one of the most frequently mentioned names around the league this offseason.

**Klint Kubiak - Seahawks OC**

Kubiak's name is heating up for good reason. He has done a spectacular job in Seattle with Darnold and that young core, and was also very productive for a bad Saints team. One of my top choices and feels like a matter of time before he becomes a HC.

**Mike Lafleur - Rams OC**

Just a really big fan of the Rams organization. One of the best run teams and the McVay tree is filled with bright minds. Lafleur is of course related to Packers HC Matt.

**Aubrey Pleasant - Rams Passing Game Coordinator**

See above. Pleasant also has knowledge on the defensive side of things, overseeing the Rams passing game through both lenses. McVay let him coach preseason games twice as well.

**Adam Stenavich - Packers OC**

Another really successful organization. Stenavich has been around the league for some time now, and even was in Michigan shortly. While not the playcaller, he has put together some really successful offenses in GB and helped to develop a talented young group.

  
***Defensive Minded Options***

Seeing as Dart has developed ahead of schedule, I think the door may be a little more open for a defensive HC, as long as he hires a good OC. Some good options here as well.

**Jesse Minter - Chargers DC**

A hot name in coaching circles. Jesse Minter has led a very successful Chargers defense and Michigan defense before that. He has learned from both the Harbaugh brothers and is a bright, young mind that is sure to be a HC some day soon.

**Jeff Hafley - Packers DC**

Another Packers coordinator. Hafley is over-qualified for the DC spot in GB, having been HC at Boston College previously, and finding success there as well. GB has had a talented defense the past 2 years, and Hafley deserves a lot of credit.

**Lou Anarumo - Colts DC**

Anarumo may not be a name that jumps to mind, but I think he deserves a mention. Did a lot of good in Cincinnati (who's defense has certainly got worse since he's left) and is part of a very successful Colts team this season. Defense has plagued us for years, and maybe this can finally be the move to solidify things, especially given all the talent we have. 

**Chris Shula - Rams DC**

Comes from a family of football. Shula has helped to rebuild this Rams defense post-Aaron Donald and seems to be a highly respected name around the league

***Wild Card Mention***

**Lane Kiffin - Ole Miss HC**

I don't think that this will happen, and I don't think it's a particularly good idea, but I DO think it deserves a mention. Probably the only college HC that we could consider, and I actually could see him taking the job. Still very unlikely imo.

**Before you say anything:** No **Jon Gruden** is not happening. Neither is **Bill Belichick** or **Brian Flores**.

  
So yeah! That's my list. Let me know what you all think and if there's any other names I should be aware of. Apologies for the lengthy post, I'm desperate over here lol. Go Big Blue! Don't slander my nigga Tommy Thibs by comparing him to Mike fuckin McCarthy, come on man... 

I think Kingsbury is the best overall bet here, plus we take him from a divisional rival, that's a Win-Win for us 

Kubiak is a real interesting choice, but great OCs don't always make competent HCs, just look at Josh McDaniels 

I think Kingsbury is the best balance of modern OC and competent HC, outta our available options

Super young relative to NFL coaching age, he can be here for all of Dart's career",410064.0,neutral

Say what you want about his game and roster management, but I genuinely believe he is good for Darts development. Who is going to be HC for the rest of the year if Daboll is gone? Kafka? Bowen? You guys realize those are the options mid season, right? They aren’t going to make an outside hire in November because your options are much more limited than in the off-season. It would be an extremely dumb move. Do they need to move on from Schoen and Daboll, yea. Do they gain anything by doing it now instead of in the off season, no.

This team is full of dudes who just collecting paychecks, knowing full well that the season is lost. 

We unfort have created an environment, with our coach, that doesn't punish dudes for it. Coughlin was hated during his early years, when the giants weren't winning, mostly because he was an asshole and would drop absolutely anyone (but Eli) for a mistake. He even took reps away from Tiki for his fumbling issues. Dropped pass, that guys on the bench. Missed coverage, that guys on the bench. 

The problem is we have little depth and a coach that can't make up for the little depth with scheme / a coach that is borderline too much of a players coach without a spine, so the poor to nonexistent efforts are acceptable. You think Coughlin would be keeping banks on the roster? Yeah there's GM gamesmanship to keep him on the roster so if he signs somewhere on a flier you get a comp pick but his tape is so so bad and he's clearly a cancer that you just need him out. Call up someone who will bleed for that shot. There's some warm body out there that will try and run support / tackle as a corner better than Deonte. Bring in some dogs at corner who tackle but with warts being their coverage and just play zone. Right now, we have guys who don't do both. When guys see that you have some cutthroat / will not tolerate that behavior, then you weed out people you don't want quickly. 

As Saban says, high achievers don't like mediocre people and vice versa. Just like in any corporate culture, keeping those people around doesn't breed a good culture of accountability.

1opzb4j,1762439913.0,3192,0.99,12,Data and Analytics ,"Jaxson Dart, Emeka Egbuka lead NFL midseason All-Rookie team. Who else earned a spot? **Quarterback**

**Jaxson Dart, New York Giants (Round 1, No. 25 pick)**

Cam Ward held this spot almost uncontested over the season’s first month, because he was the lone rookie quarterback to start from day one. But Dart surged past him in October and made this an easy choice at the midway point.

Despite having made three fewer starts than Ward, Dart has twice as many passing touchdowns (10) and half as many interceptions (three) as Ward (five and six, respectively) plus five rushing touchdowns (to Ward’s zero). Dart also leads all rookie QBs in completion percentage (62.3), yards per attempt (6.7) and yards per completion (10.8).

He is still playing like a rookie — his 46.1 percent offensive success rate is in the bottom half of the league, sandwiched between Carson Wentz and Justin Fields. But his early command of the offense and unflinching play style are promising for a quarterback-starved organization.

Runner-up: Cam Ward, Tennessee Titans (Round 1, No. 1)



**Running back**

Quinshon Judkins, Cleveland Browns (Round 2, No. 36)

**Runner-up: Cam Skattebo, New York Giants (Round 4, No. 105)**

Skattebo won’t have a chance to build on his impressive start after suffering a season-ending ankle injury, but he deserves recognition. Though his 51.3 rushing yards per game places him behind Jeanty, Hampton and Judkins, he is tied with Judkins in yards per carry (4.1) and rushing touchdowns. And Skattebo leads all rookie backs in catches (24), receiving yards (207) and total first downs (38).

Aside from the stats, he also passes the “vibes” test. The Giants’ offense felt wildly different in Week 9 with Skattebo out of the lineup.



**Edge defender**

**Abdul Carter, New York Giants (Round 1, No. 2)**

“Carter only has a half sack!” I get it. Ideally, that number should be higher. (The Cardinals’ Walter Nolen just made his NFL debut Monday night and already has more.)

But Carter is consistently affecting the backfield, as evidenced by his 32 pressures, which leads all rookies and ranks No. 1 on the Giants (three ahead of teammate Brian Burns). His pass-rush productivity percentage (6.7 percent), which includes hits and hurries along with sacks, is better than T.J. Watt’s (6.3) or Maxx Crosby’s (5.7).

Fans might be frustrated with Carter’s low sacks total, especially after he played his least-productive game Sunday against the 49ers, but Carter is clearly impacting the game.

Runner-up: Donovan Ezeiruaku, Dallas Cowboys (Round 2, No. 44) I wish they still gave credit for sacks when they get there and there is also an accepted penalty on the offense. It makes sense why they don’t, but I can think of at least 2 times for Carter, and 2.5 sacks with his pressure rate would look a lot better… that said, anyone who says he isn’t playing well is only looking at box scores and isn’t taking the Shane Bowen effect into account, this kid is a stud and I have no doubt will be unleashed with a real DC",41081.0,negative

Runner-up: Donovan Ezeiruaku, Dallas Cowboys (Round 2, No. 44) If both Dart and Carter develop and reach their full potential, and Skat can fully recover and return to form, this could be a generation-definiting draft class.

The 22/23 draft classes specifically 1-3 rounds killed the giants. Bad drafting is the reason why they spend money to get talent. The 23 class is the worst draft class in the teams history and I think this is the death of the Joe Schoen era. Majority of the class isn’t even on the team anymore, Banks is a bust, Jury is still out on JMS and Hyatt is a bust or lost cause. He missed on 2nd round picks and 3rd round picks. He’s going to point to better draft classes in 24/25 but Nabers and Carter were no brainer picks. But Nubin looks like a bust after his regression this season. Neal, first round bust.

Especially with the new money coming in from sell the 10% stake, allows us to put more future money in escrow so we can use void years if wanted.

BTJ was a lower floor prospect compared to Nabers. Odunze was lower ceiling. What made Nabers a no brainer in my eyes was that he had both a very high floor AND a super high ceiling. I truly believe he can be a top 3 WR in the league if he bounces back and Dart is the real deal.",22472.0,neutral

My friends said they were getting into the NFL and asked me who I'd support (We're British). I always support the first team I know about so in this case it was the Giants (because of Joey from friends).

Anyway, that first season I think we started 0-6 or 1-6 and I couldn't understand why people found this sport entertaining, as the Giants were awful to watch, and the word Boring pretty much sums it up, but I persisted because at least it was interesting enough learning all the rules etc..

Then something incredible happened.. we drafted OBJ.

For the first time for me, watching this sport became really entertaining! Sure the giants would still lose a lot of games, and a lot of them in true Giants fashion setting the tone for the next decade (losing by one score on the last play of the game) but watching a player like OBJ make incredible catches, and just bring the X factor to the team was worth it!

Then we got Saquon too, and he started bringing that same excitement, things are looking up! But they weren't.. and then OBJ got traded, and then Saquon got traded, and here we are. Without players like that it becomes boring to watch again.

The one thing I noticed, every single season since I started watching in 2013.. the giants have never had a decent O-line. And it makes me wonder what could have been if we did.

Either way, this season with Jax and Skatt and Nabers and Burns I think we can all see that there's something to be excited about again for next season. 

But I think we really need to give the offence the best chance possible to succeed. Get a top tier O-line together, and get another top receiver to help out Nabers.

He was an exceptionally talented receiver while he was here, but he was also an exceptionally divisive figure pretty much every season after his rookie breakout. I’m not looking to shit on him here necessarily cuz he also did a lot of good, and the team as a whole was crumbling; but I still think it’s a mistake and a bit revisionist to remember him as a Giants hero.

The perception of what it means to be a great New York Giant has been so grotesquely distorted and warped these days, at least from my perspective.

Hopefully we see the rise of some truly great Giants in the coming years so that newer fans get more of a perspective on why fans that have been here through some of the better times have mixed feelings about OBJ despite his undeniably great talent.

All of that said Odell would not provide much to this team in 2025 imo, other than something for the media to write a few articles about. Hes not the same guy he was, and even if he *was* close to that level of ability, another slant specialist out of the slot does very little for the team. It’s basically the Wandale role. They are in pretty dire need of a big body red zone threat, which is basically the opposite of Odell’s skillset even in his prime. Someone like DK Metcalf or Mike Evans (injured and not available but to give an example of the type of WR I’m talking about) would be way more useful for this team. Dart is pretty solid moving the ball over the 50, it’s the second part of the drive when the field shortens and you need to win contested catches that the offense hits a wall.",105938.0,neutral

Sure the giants would still lose a lot of games, and a lot of them in true Giants fashion setting the tone for the next decade (losing by one score on the last play of the game) but watching a player like OBJ make incredible catches, and just bring the X factor to the team was worth it!

Then we got Saquon too, and he started bringing that same excitement, things are looking up! But they weren't.. and then OBJ got traded, and then Saquon got traded, and here we are. Without players like that it becomes boring to watch again.

The one thing I noticed, every single season since I started watching in 2013.. the giants have never had a decent O-line. And it makes me wonder what could have been if we did.

Either way, this season with Jax and Skatt and Nabers and Burns I think we can all see that there's something to be excited about again for next season. 

But I think we really need to give the offence the best chance possible to succeed. Get a top tier O-line together, and get another top receiver to help out Nabers. I know most would like Waddle, or for us to draft someone. And call it sentimental, but I'd love to see OBJ back in blue. Without trying to be biased, he's got the best hands I've seen in the NFL over the last 12 years and made catches no-one else could. Sure he may have lost some explosiveness, but he'd be the perfect guy for a safe and sure 5 yard slant to just keep the chains moving. And he recently said he'd love to play for us again before retiring.

Anyway, point is, as fans we've survived the last 12 years of misery, with a few moments of false hope. I think we deserve a good season, and it feels like we're gonna get one next year!  I love the Giants but, I've learned to ""not hold my breath"" when it comes to them. I try not to get attached to players but it's hard. I have a sneaky suspicion that if the front office and coaching staff get let go then I wouldn't be surprised if some of these guys we love like Dex",17656.0,neutral

Mike McCarthy Spags. I know he's old, and I recognize that I'm probably seeing him with blue-tinted glasses here. But he's a great defensive mind, players like him, and hes familiar with organization. We, as a team, need to establish a legitimate identity and turn things (even slightly) around, before making big swings. We got fucked by doing that without a structure/culture in place.


Plus, we are the exact opposite of a hot commodity right now. I don't think young coaches are going to champing at the big to come here. Spags, looking for an HC role and knowing the Giants, would be a solid choice to lead the turn around for the next few years.",92957.0,negative

Today I searched ""Giants trade"" on Xwitter just to see if anything was happening, but ""Giants trade up for Dart"" from the draft popped up. So I went into the replies to see all the people upset by it, then went to their profiles to see if they changed their minds, or if they were saying anything about him now. 

What I found was that a large majority of people pissed off about Dart were not even Giants fans. Of the majority who were not even Giants fans, most were Shedeur fans or something. Just talking about Colorado, or bitching about some conspiracy why Shedeur isn't starting for the Browns. 

Of the Giants fans that were pissed, I found 1 person who changed their mind on Dart. The other two dozen or so I looked at have 0 mentions of Dart, no retweets, no replies about him for the time I spent looking at their posts. Most are just complaining about losing, a few were talking about Skattebo.

So what do I take away from this? Probably, people don't want to admit they were wrong, so you, sir, are a rare breed being able to eat crow. Otherwise, I don't know what to take away from it. It just seems odd that the ones who were Giants fans, only one had changed their mind on Dart, and the rest just flat out refused even to acknowledge him at all.",121187.0,negative

 -via Sports Condensed It’s actually an argument that’s been blown up in the media and doesn’t seem to actually be true. Is there possibly an appearance that more players get hurt at MetLife? Sure. But you also have to remember that MetLife has twice the games played on it, so there is more of an opportunity for players to get hurt on it. 

Also, according to the below article, “MetLife's continuing bad reputation is perhaps based on stale data. Per Russini, the playing field ranked ninth-best when it came to lower-extremity injuries in a 2024 study.

So why not just go grass and silence the argument forever? According to the league’s injury data, MetLife doesn’t fit the villain label. In 2024, the field ranked ninth-best when it came to lower-extremity injuries, according to that data. And for visiting players, who are typically more vulnerable on unfamiliar surfaces, MetLife actually graded out first, safest in the NFL.”

People here were gushing over Singletary by week 3 last year with comparable volume just to follow up with 14 rushes for 24 yards in week 4 and pretty much all of his individual success tanked for the rest of the season. 

That said, if the trend continues and we're in the last couple weeks of the season where they both have a decent sample size, then I think it's fair to start knocking it.",189869.0,positive

 You know I been defending him all year. But after this game, it’s obvious he lost the team. When you got vets giving up the writing is on the wall.

I also think he is weak mentally and it rubs off on the team. Past few weeks the giants get screwed on something(tush push fumble, SF false start on their second possession) and Daboll loses his shit. 

Bowen is terrible too. We lost 3 games this year that they should’ve won.

It’s not fair because they are all hurt but honestly, the whole FO and staff has to go at this point. There are pieces here. We got a DL and we have a QB, WR1, HB, LT. that should be enough to get a good GM and a good coach. It sucks because there are good things that Schoen does but this season shows that the team crumbles under injury. 

We have no secondary or receivers due to injury. We have an old injured kicker that was hurt 2 years in a row. We have no coaching scheme to stop the run. We have no TEs. This is a problem.

I wanted to keep Schoen and Daboll because of Dart and how we looked early. But we just can’t keep floundering like this. We can’t keep being in games early and lose due to rushing 3 or mismanagement of time and then the players give up.

 I don’t think he should necessarily be fired now. They aren’t winning anything this year. Who knows what the locker room culture is like? Who knows how helpful he has been to Dart? Those are things you fire a coach for mid season.

 Dart has a lot of developing to do with regards to how the game is played inside the pocket at the NFL level and delivering deep balls with his legs too as opposed to just his arm, but Daboll is not the guy to bring any amount of value there.

The other stuff he possesses which has been the sole difference are things that comes with the player naturally and thank goodness for this fact. If not that for that, this team has nothing, both Schoen and Daboll and the rest of the staff besides maybe the O line coach have been worth a damn.

I don't even see a saving grace for the GM at this point either; it's been so bad for so long that he needed to hit on more moves and drafts, the offense is too devoid of talent and depth and almost nothing is coached well enough and nothing seems to develop and other parts regress due to injury. It's not a winning formula.

Maybe a better coach gets players deemed busts to be able to see the field and they get more out of guys all around and considering the front and back-office systems put into place, perhaps the perspective on the GM is a bit narrow but it's also hard to keep him if you're not going to commit there and allow him to land the next coach. Tough decision and figuring how much that will affect the coaching change and if ultimately you end up having to get rid of him too maybe the best time to do so would be at the same time.

I don't see how running it back is going to be any better, you would have to be convinced that time is the only missing piece, it's clearly not. There are no guarantees either way, but we have a sample size and it's not good, there are no indicators things are headed in the right direction as a whole. I would also argue improved offense and scoring, which is mostly on Dart, as well as an improved defense from a talent perspective, while still finding ways to lose, is actually more indictment than it is improvement.",680205.0,negative

I can't watch another season of this.  The pieces are here, I don't trust them with those pieces.  And I don't want to have another season of seeing horrible decisions costing us games and possibly the playoffs.



 I agree with you that he should be fired but I would just wait till the end of the year. If they keep him for Dart then it’s going to be another lost year. He’s not a good HC.",453470.0,negative
1on1my1,1762156285.0,1854,0.93,262,Discussion,"This man needs to go. Beyond not wanting change, I have no clue why any one wants to keep this man.  He's not developing Dart, Dart is already there, so we are not losing anything there.

  
But let's go into some stats about him.  Since he started with the Giants, he has coached 61 games and has a .347 winning %.

In those 61 games, we have:  Lost 17 games by 2 or more TDs. Which means every 3.6 games we are seeing a loss by at least 14 points.  From those, 6 games were by 21 or more points.  1 by over 28 points and 1 by 40 points.

In that same time, we have seen only 3 wins, where we won by more than 14 points.  So we're not seeing competitive football, or real winning football.

So the positive feelings you have this year, is because Dart is saving him.  But yet again, this year we saw staples of a Daboll team including unprepared with his kickers, causing us to lose games, letting games get out of control, without being able to stop the bleeding.  Causing us to lose games.  Causing us 3-4 wins this year alone.

Also, in his tenure, we have lost to the worst teams in the NFL including the Jets, Panthers and the Saints.

That is not even talking about all the players that have left his regime, that got the blame, and became winners.

Or the coaches he blamed, that left, and also became winners.

We get Malik and Skat back healthy, with some draft help and an improved O line and I love our offense next year.  He's shown composure, competiveness and toughness on a team that's as soft as a down pillow.  Dropsy, alligator-arms receiving corps.  Whenever one of the Giants gets hit, they wimp-limp off.  Did you see Banks' ""tackle"" on that long TD run?  I don't even think Robinson, Jr. noticed it as he was strolling towards the end zone.  No one is ever called out for anything.  So Dart seems almost self-motivated.   Back in the day, Simms was one of the toughest guys on those tough-as-nails teams.  Today, Dart is tough in the midst of a vacuum and everyone seems content to let him do most of the hard work in the red zone.  You would hope a RB, WR or TE might want to score.  But apparently not, and our brilliant coaching staff just keeps calling that same number.  He showed something today even after it was clear the defense had completely laid down.

They’re the common denominators that have run our beloved team into the ground across multiple regimes since 2012. A few weeks ago I lamented that the Giants defense always gives up points immediately after scoring themselves. They haven’t had a defensive stop after a score since Week 6. How does Shane Bowen still have a job?

I targeted McDonnell, Mara and Abrams because I thought them being out of the office with John still owning the team could be a possibly symbiotic relationship. It’s not. Ownership is being set up to make the impossible choice of sticking with Daboll for 2026 to develop Dart and keep the infectious stench of losing his tenure has brought, or wipe the slate clean and risk Dart’s development. It’s the same impossible choice they forced on Schoen and Daboll in 2022 whether they wanted to stick with Jones and Saquon or start fresh. The Giants haven’t gotten their timing right since Coughlin and Eli, and it’s why firing Schoen and Daboll after last year would’ve made sense.

I now think it’s nearly impossible for the Giants to be competitive as long as Mara and Tisch are the owners. For as much as Bowen needs to go, we need to have a conversation about the Mara’s and Tisch’s being forced to sell the team. That might be the only way forward at this point…

P.S.- Gano still has a $5.7M cap hit and Slayton’s still making $36M through 2027. Two guys that desperately need to be cut.

P.S.S.- I don’t blame Dexter Lawrence for being pissed at Carl Banks for his comments and being pissed at the Giants for wasting his career while his best friends are all succeeding with other teams, but Banks has every right to sound off on his play and us fans have a right to be pissed at him. Dexter’s energy has become infectious for all the wrong reasons, it’s showing in his play and it’s seeped into the rest of the locker room. He might be the best nose tackle in NFL history, but a leader he is not. He’s followed the example instead of setting his own.

Basically coach said that while measurables are a real thing they are overstated; there are other aspects that can make up for those. In the case of Mbow, he has good hands and athleticism and can restablish hands as needed and doesn't play shortarmed like someone who may have the requisite arm length. 

Also other takeaways, seems to not want to pigeonhole players early on in their careers and allow them to develop. Also mentions Belichick having things to say about arm length, sounded like tongue in cheek comment meaning that good coaches realize tape matters more than measurements sorta thing. 

Anyway, I've been relatively pleased with how the unit has developed under Bricillo, I think any players underperforming such as Neal/JMS are just not the right players more likely than it is our coaching.",227006.0,positive

Short arms are a disadvantage but they're not a killer if the rest of your game overcomes that disadvantage (See: Will Campbell this year). Acting like a player is doomed at tackle just because of short arms has been consistently disproven.. but there are other flaws that Mbow has (That he absolutely could improve/develop over time with) in the same area that were highlighted against the Chiefs. Yet there's a ton of positive to work with for him. I do think Mbow is going to be similar to Pugh (Who ironically to the topic had the exact same arm length) where he'll be serviceable up-and-down at tackle but very good on the inside long term. In either case you give him the opportunity to try at tackle first since that's where he's comfortable and you don't want to overwhelm a rookie. Once he's settled into the NFL for a year then you can start playing with where he helps the team the most. He's absolutely a promising player, and am excited to see his development wherever he settles on the OL.",43239.0,positive

That draft in April Schoen wastes literally pick on a bust. Year 2 DJ gets hurt you cant hold that against daboll. Year 3 DJ comes back a shell of himself and he didn't play well at all. On top of that BB and Dex had injuries. Year 4 Daboll gets to finally pick his QB and as soon as his guy gets behind center we became a top 6 offense in football and that was without a top 5 WR. Yes we've lost 6 games but 3 of those came with russ , Denver was on the defense and bowen , New Orleans was dart first road game & he and skatt had some costly fumbles you cant blame a coach for players fumbling in plus territory, and people will ask , "" well why didn't he start dart from day 1?"" . Because it's obvious they didn't want dart out there without AT. This offense is on fire with practice squad WRs , and before last week we had a top 10 rushing attack yet people dont want to give daboll any credit for how well this offense has been playing. Every opposing DC either before and/or after they play us acknowledge how well dart is playing and how well daboll has done bringing him along. Imo he deserves to coach the last year of his contract out and if we dont make the PO or have a .500 record next year when we're healthy then we can just go sign a new HC without a buyout being needed. ",75168.0,positive

Say what you want about him as a HC, but his players fight for him and he appears to be properly developing Dart. If the team continues to fight for him in another lost season then I think he’ll stay and deservedly so.

This sub puts a lot of blame on him for the bad. The kicker situation is I’d argue 90% Joe Schoen’s fault unfortunately. The lack of depth is 100% Joe Schoen’s fault. Joe criminally underrates linebacker and now we can’t stop the run.

Daboll is far from blameless, but IMO Schoen has been the main culprit. I mean shit our most important pick was Dart who looks great and Joe Schoen made it CLEAR this was Daboll’s guy so I literally give him zero credit for the pick lol",75168.0,positive

Dart is going to be good but Daboll is doing everything to protect him with the majority of his play calls in shotgun. He’s got no weapons and a mixed bag of a OL. IMO he’s at solid B+ WTH room for improvement. I usually don’t fully start judging a QB until at least 3 years of starting but I think it’s fair to say he’s not only a future franchise QB but a top 10-15 QB in the league, which was what Eli was during his career. Eli was about top 12-15 at his peak. I’ll take that if that’s what Darts floor is going to be, which I believe it will be.

1. Hold on the first TD - probably but it honestly looks like Dean just fell but fine let's say that was a hold. That cancels out with the missed false start on Mailata they called offside, since that would have been 2nd and 12 and a completely different set of playcalls. You can also say ""oh they would have scored anyway"" on both drives or both drives just end in a FG

2. Hurts got the first down before the tush push-the ball was in his left hand which was behind the marker so no he didn't

3. Dart actually fumbled- Maybe but that fact that they overturned the call means its indisputable evidence even if it was only by millimeters. 

That still leaves the ""OPI"" on Slayton. Which you can also say cancels out the TD from 1, but that still leaves +4 for Eagles if they had to kick a FG from 2nd and 12. And of course the tush push, which we could have very easily taken back the other way. So thats basically +7 at minimum for taking away their TD, and probably +14 if we return it. So even the most generous of interpretations means its only a 7 point swing when the game was still close but most likely somewhere between 14-21 points the Eagles benefitted from, which obviously would have changed the way the teams played but its not as simple as ""hurr durr, 18 pt win refs made Hurts throw 4 TD"" that the dumb Eagles fans are saying",45411.0,neutral

Daboll to the media is still the guy who supposedly coached Tua into being a first round pick and coached Josh Allen into the player he is today. That's literally his calling card. I've seen nothing from Daboll as a play caller or CEO coach that shows he's a good coach.",194233.0,negative

Thanks guys :) hope you all have a lovely day Too much credit being given here, so much bias, remove the elite improv ability of Josh Allen and Dart and Daboll is nothing near a head coach. He's not a whisperer nor does it take a genius to figure out that kind of mobility as a talent but Allen having been super raw yet possessing those tangibles, fools everyone.

He's made a lot of good connections and seems to be a solid yes man and team player as a subordinate for many elite coaches and systems and within the Giants organization now but does not extend the same level of grace to others under him, he can't manage simple concepts of football and game management, and his philosophy is very QB dependent, why we have crap WR's for years who don't do the small and detail oriented things, that conventional pocket passers can't function under, nor the type of route concepts that they can execute without running around, escaping and trying to create something out of nothing. Things don't work within the passing system as often as people think it does.

Remember, this guy wanted everyone to believe he was a whisperer and a guru and made Josh Allen and that Daniel Jones couldn't play, now wants everyone to believe that he's also not an MVP caliper player on a great team, nor top candidate for comeback player of the year. Anyone who is a coach can choose to be a player's coach and coddle a very mobile QB.

While at it, take a look at what a good coach does with a more traditional type of pocket passer QB like Daniel Jones, look at the route concepts and where they are relative to the field and each other, how they break on routes and have spatial awareness relative to what the defenses are doing on each play, look at how he has total command at the line including protections, how they don't neglect a true run game for two seasons, they actually have a handle on the defensive side of the ball.

I could go on but you get the point, and not every team can have a top offensive line but there is still plenty of things that were handled and coached wrong within the Giants the last several years even with an elite improv QB talent now.",52973.0,neutral

Thanks guys :) hope you all have a lovely day Part of it is that he was a very sought after candidate after his time in Buffalo that he was widely considered a home run when we hired him. He spent time with Belichick during some of those later Super Bowl wins and won a national championship as OC at Alabama too. General consensus was that he was a great HC candidate so I think a lot of people have a hard time grasping how wrong that has been.

I personally think he’s better than all those coaches you mentioned but it’s a low bar. A decent offensive mind, but he comes off to me as a front runner type of coach where any hint of adversity throws him off the rails. It worked well enough year 1 but it looks like his emotions get the best of him and the team spirals easily under his watch.",141260.0,negative

Well Daboll got ""his guy"" in Dart, and the offense has been fucking humming on all cylinders, save for last week, (where they still might've hung 30 if not for penalties) they've posted 30+ points against some good nfl defenses. (Without Nabers mind you)

How many times did we beg for more than two TDs in a game? The offense with Jones (through 3 HCs mind you) always stalled out.

If it were a hip drop, i’m sure the giants players would  be saying something. 
If you ever played, you’d realize its really easy to do some “illegal” things, while making a tackle. 
No idea how they expect you to tackle a qb, but not land with your bodyweight on top of them. Sometimes its just how the collision works, and your balance is slightly off.

That said, what he has to come up with is remarkable now given the personnel. 

Our defense is actually very easy to strategically beat. Run outside zone because our corners can't tackle and once in a while up the middle to keep us honest. Quick throws to neutralize pass rush and once in a while deep shot in double move that should be absolutely wide open because we have practice squad corners and our safeties are mediocre at best. Oh, and play action when Shane calls a collapse on runner play, which should also be wide open. 

There's now enough tape on basically all of the above too, which will make the next handful of games interesting if the other team half executes. I honestly don't see a reality where don't give up at least 25-30 pts a game. 

Oh...and when our best RB and #1 WR are out and our #2 WR drops catches and our tight ends suck, it's hard to really scheme a dynamic offense lol.

2023:

Worst shut-out at home in franchise history (Week 1 vs Cowboys, 40-0).

First team in NFL history to lose a game by 40+ points, be out-sacked by seven or more, have a turnover ratio of -3 or more, have a blocked FG returned for a TD, and throw a pick six **in a season.** They did it all in one game. (Week 1). 

Most uncontested points to start a season in NFL history (Weeks 1-2, 60 points. Record was 54). 

Fewest points scored at home in first two games in franchise history (Weeks 1 and 4, 3 points).

Surrendered 11 sacks and a pick-six, second time in NFL history (Week 4 vs Seattle, first time since 1967).

Allowed a Cowboys record 6 players to score TDs from the line of scrimmage (Week 10).

Suffered two of three worst losses against the Cowboys in franchise history (Weeks 1 and 10).

Failed to score on the first possession of every game in a season (first time since 1997).

Worst OLine in PFF History.

Allowed second most sacks in a season in NFL history (85).",433200.0,negative

The running back currently has a 4x$5.2M AAV contract with NYG. How would you describe Cam Skattebo's rookie season? ""Season final stats"" drives this home. I don't care so much about the rest of this season,  and it's not said with gloom or hopes of tanking. I hope the Giants players remaining get some Ws. I hate that we're 2 months in and I'm already looking forward to NEXT season, but my expectations for 2025 were pretty low anyway. If 2025 has to crawl for 2026+ to run, I'm good with it.
Side note: I'd almost forgotten about Tyrone Tracy and I'm glad he reminded me that we have another great RB.",3324321.0,negative

1. Baun never swivels/swings his hips/legs forward. If you watch the video, they actually stay behind his upper body the whole time.

2. He doesn't land on Skattebo - Skatt landed on his own leg, and thats where the injury happened. There are very clear pictures from the back showing this his foot & leg is pinned under himself, not Baun (one can be found here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/eagles/comments/1ohf8oo/was\_this\_a\_hip\_drop\_tackle/](https://www.reddit.com/r/eagles/comments/1ohf8oo/was_this_a_hip_drop_tackle/) )

3. If you want to get very technical about it, the Hip-Drop rule specifically applies to ball carriers, which Cam was not.

  
Hate to see this happen and wish Cam nothing but the best & a speedy recovery, but this wasn't a Hip-Drop or a dirty play. It was an unfortunate accident that happened in a sport that's violent by design. Anyone saying otherwise is just looking for somebody to blame.",23474.0,negative

Eagles fans being the least objective, least logical, fan base there is, followed closely behind by the Giants fans. Every call is a bad call if it’s against the Eagles and every call is perfect if it helps them. They arent even objective enough to see their own lack of objectivity. 

The distinction here that i think Eagles fans are missing is that it does not make Zach Baun a dirty player to be called  (or not called but later fined, as will be the case here) for a hip drop tackle. It is a textbook hip drop tackle. Whether Skattebo made the catch or no is not relevant. The tackle is all thats relevant. 

Baun clearly swivels his hips to the side, unweighting himself and pulling Skattebo straight down. And then Skattebo sustained one of the 3 major injuries the rule was created to prevent. 

Skattebo ran him over 3 times in the last game. Baun talked about it on “Bussin with the Boys” after rhe week 6 game. He was clearly just trying to make a stop. It was not dirty, hes not a dirty player, in fact afterwards he reached out to Cam to check on him. Pretty standup move if you ask me. 

But the play is a hip drop tackle, by definition, you could literally show the view from behind Skattebo in slow motion and watch what Baun does as an educational video on what a hip drop looks like. 

People think the runner has to be grabbed from behind while moving and pulled down, although that is the type we see more often, thats not whats in the rule.",15649.0,negative

Coaching: for the past two years Daboll’s been on the hot seat. I’ve understood both sides and have tried to think as rationally about it as possible. Tried to give Daboll the benefit of the doubt regarding the roster. But, he needs to go. I’ve enjoyed Dart and what he’s done this year, but I don’t think it’s solely because of Daboll. Daboll has shown time and time again that he cannot lead a team. More often than not, one unit plays well, but the others lack. He’s had enough time, but his incompetence is constantly shown through the amount of dumb penalties we get, not creative play calling, and lack to complete a full game.

Bowen: this dude blows. Players don’t trust him, never gives an advantage, and is constantly putting the defense in a bad spot. Everyone knows he’s garbage. But, this ultimately points to Daboll more than anything. Coaches didn’t want the position, so we’re left with this guy who’s ultimately become a martyr for Daboll

Schoen: Wanted Schoen to work out so bad. Really liked his process. But, man this guys just doesn’t have good results. The roster is ok, but it’s always filled with too many holes. Our receivers aren’t good. Tight end’s are mediocre, Oline has slightly improved but man could be better. And then the defense, who is supposed to be the crown jewel of this team, is so inconsistent. 

Slayton: This guy is such a loser. Been a giants fan for 20 years. Man, this dude just gives off such loser energy. He is so mediocre and Schoen is paying his ass for the next 2 years. 

Positives: Dart and Skat (Rip my sweet prince). Burns is insane. Thibs looks good. Nabers back next year. This team has some good bones. Hopefully a new regime can help take us to the next level, rather than tear everything down I don't put a ton of blame on what happened today on Daboll.

Coaching: for the past two years Daboll’s been on the hot seat. I’ve understood both sides and have tried to think as rationally about it as possible. Tried to give Daboll the benefit of the doubt regarding the roster. But, he needs to go. I’ve enjoyed Dart and what he’s done this year, but I don’t think it’s solely because of Daboll. Daboll has shown time and time again that he cannot lead a team. More often than not, one unit plays well, but the others lack. He’s had enough time, but his incompetence is constantly shown through the amount of dumb penalties we get, not creative play calling, and lack to complete a full game.

Bowen: this dude blows. Players don’t trust him, never gives an advantage, and is constantly putting the defense in a bad spot. Everyone knows he’s garbage. But, this ultimately points to Daboll more than anything. Coaches didn’t want the position, so we’re left with this guy who’s ultimately become a martyr for Daboll

Schoen: Wanted Schoen to work out so bad. Really liked his process. But, man this guys just doesn’t have good results. The roster is ok, but it’s always filled with too many holes. Our receivers aren’t good. Tight end’s are mediocre, Oline has slightly improved but man could be better. And then the defense, who is supposed to be the crown jewel of this team, is so inconsistent. 

Slayton: This guy is such a loser. Been a giants fan for 20 years. Man, this dude just gives off such loser energy. He is so mediocre and Schoen is paying his ass for the next 2 years.

Daboll has had 1 above average season, followed by 3 terrible seasons. Yet, somehow he has been given a longer leash than Bill Belichick.

He does not in any way elevate what talent his players do have. When things start to unravel during a game, he has no clue how to regroup, settle his team down, and make adjustments. Also, his overall player development has been very unimpressive.

While Schoen has acquired ‘some’ good players, when you consider the fact that he was drafting in the top ten 3 out of 4 years, what he has done is not impressive. His overall body of work is not good.

He put together the roster that produced the worst record in the 100 year history of the franchise. Our defense is the 2nd highest paid in the NFL, but they are soft at the line of scrimmage and can’t stop the run worth a damn.

How people can continue to simp for this regime is beyond me.",123273.0,negative

Schoen: Wanted Schoen to work out so bad. Really liked his process. But, man this guys just doesn’t have good results. The roster is ok, but it’s always filled with too many holes. Our receivers aren’t good. Tight end’s are mediocre, Oline has slightly improved but man could be better. And then the defense, who is supposed to be the crown jewel of this team, is so inconsistent.

Coaching: for the past two years Daboll’s been on the hot seat. I’ve understood both sides and have tried to think as rationally about it as possible. Tried to give Daboll the benefit of the doubt regarding the roster. But, he needs to go. I’ve enjoyed Dart and what he’s done this year, but I don’t think it’s solely because of Daboll. Daboll has shown time and time again that he cannot lead a team. More often than not, one unit plays well, but the others lack. He’s had enough time, but his incompetence is constantly shown through the amount of dumb penalties we get, not creative play calling, and lack to complete a full game.

Zebras have too much impact  There is an analogy that comes to mind here, from a British defense advocate in a famous libel case about Holocaust denial.  ""The honest waiter.""


If the waiter is honest, he incorrectly gives change to the tune of both overcharging, and undercharging, over time it evens out.


Sure felt like in this game, there was a very clear bias towards overcharging from the refs against the Giants.


Case in point - that last OPI call.  I thought that we have established for years that grabbing the jersey is pretty much auto PI.  DB grabs the receivers jersey after mutual handfighting, and it's OPI?  The barometer here is so fucked up that it's either non-existent or convenient ",857228.0,negative

The NFL makes so much money they can pay for year round ref salaries and have huge development courses. However they keep having part timers and intentionally keep a large element of doubt by not modernizing. They can use stuff like chips to perfectly call where the ball is, or have more review, but are against any attempt at making reffing more accurate. Which implies they want it inaccurate. Even after huge backlash with cheifs favoritism they do nothing but defend horrible officiating that they are creating. 


Would not suprise me at all if the NFL keeps it this way to try to influence the outcome for exciting matchups, which has caused players and refs to exploit it for gambling reasons that the NFL looks the other way on since an investigation would unconver their own fixing.

I think it’s a bit optimistic to say that it will not have any impact on his ability to perform next year. In an ideal world, sure, this would be a straightforward ankle fracture dislocation that heals perfectly with surgery and he’s back on the field next year performing at the same level. But there’s also a lot of ways that doesn’t happen - infection, nonunion, articular injury, persistent pain, etc. So while we should all hope for the best, it’s far from guaranteed that all will be well come 2026.

Edit: I don’t mean to sound pessimistic. I meant to write this comment in response to the person who said their wife is an orthopod and that this injury won’t have any impact on his ability to perform next year. For the record, I’m not only hopeful that he’ll come right back, I think there’s a good chance he’ll be ok long term. NFL players are built different.

Listen, I know everyone was big on BTJ after last year but this year he's leading the league in drops. The dude has got bricks for hands. He's got 9 right now so he's on pace for 18-20 drops this year. In the last 5 years, no player has had more than 13 drops, and he's on pace for close to 20

The dude is Slayton 2.0 except like worse somehow.

The amount the Giants would need to give up for someone like that is not worth it. There's a reason the Jags are listening for calls on a WR they just drafted when they're 4-3.

Robinson, who is on the final year year of his rookie contract, has stepped up big in his role since superstar wide out Malik Nabers toe his ACL on September 28th. 

In the last three games, Robinson has 209 yards on 17 receptions and a touchdown. It’s also worth noting that he is averaging 12.3 yards a catch.

He has 203 yards after catch which is seventh among wide receivers this season.

He has the traits to be a top slot receiver in the league. 

A long-term deal needs to happen.  I love him as a fan favorite personally but he is so absolutely and massively overrated by this fan base.

I don't understand this post and the media in general constantly singing Kafkas praises and saying he's a head coach candidate when his offenses are constantly garbage. Even this Denver game, one TD was a complete fluke (tipped pass to open receiver) and the final minute TD was actually awful play calling on that drive. Instead of having dart work the sidelines and run the hurry up they just had him stand in the pocket and try to throw hail Mary's???

The offense played really well all things considered. Could they have run it more near the end? Maybe. But I think Daboll was worried about not being able to get first downs by just running, and he obviously had no confidence in the defense's ability to get stops at that point, so he decided it was better to just call plays normally and accept the risk.

Is the defense's complete implosion also partially his fault? Absolutely, but that doesn't have much to do with the offense.

It's not a conundrum. It's a very simple thing. You win games by scoring more points than the other team scores on you. If your offense continually scores a bunch of points, but your defense gives up more points than that to the other team because they're terrible, then you won't win games. It's a simple concept.

The conundrum, if there is one, is why a defense that seemingly has so many terrific athletes/players on it keeps giving up that many points.",110200.0,negative

At that point, the teams basically traded scores until the end of OT. That's entirely different than the Denver game.


The Saints game is also not on Daboll. The team had 5 turnovers. If we had even 2 fewer, its a win. I cant put that on Daboll, that doesn't make sense.


I can't get behind the ""Daboll is the boss"" logic either. At least, not fully. His biggest mistake thus far is not replacing Bowen. Thats a problem. But the HC can't insert himself into every play call made by a coordinator. Not only does that undermine the job, but its spreads the HC thin.

Daboll is responsible for his staff, which has been terrible. He can’t manage during games and make the right decisions - you can deflect blame onto coordinators all you want but there are times the head coach needs to step in and make good decisions and say to Shane Bowen, we are not dropping 8. We are staying in the defensive looks that got us in position to win. We are staying aggressive. Instead, he lets the meltdown happen and then gets mad at Bowen after the fact. 

This team is not disciplined at all. Week after week, the same dumb penalties from the same players. The Giants beat writers have mentioned this, but it seems like there’s no consequences for the players on this team. It’s a loose culture, guys seemingly do whatever they want and get away with it. Jordan Raanan actually said that someone from the locker room had told him they were worried about Malik Nabers because he’s Daboll’s guy and gets to do whatever he wants and that could become a problem eventually. There’s no structure, and if there is nobody from the outside seems to see it. 

Jaxson Dart looking very impressive and flashing signs that he could be a superstar in the making and him being Daboll’s guy does not mean the Giants should keep Daboll around. For that one positive, even if it’s a big one, there are many more negatives about Daboll remaining the head coach. It really can’t be overstated how important having a good staff and maintaining a good culture is and Daboll just can’t seem to do it. The kicking situation which should be the easiest of all things to handle on the roster has been a problem, and legitimately cost the Giants games already. It just seems like this coaching staff doesn’t even do the little things right. 

He should be out as HC the moment the season ends. Really unfortunate considering we drafted Dart and he’s been thriving but at the same time, this isn’t the guy that should be leading Dart or the rest of the team beyond 2025.",293162.0,negative

1ocf9qz,1761059267.0,498,0.92,90,Meme/Shitpost,"10.21.2025 Update  From 1 to 10 just like that. We went from a franchise altering win to a franchise altering loss in literally two games. This game has earned its rightful place on the scale, permanently. 

Imagine all of the shit we could be talking about right now. How we took a rookie QB with no wide-outs into the home of the best defense in the NFL and dropped 32 points on em without a run game. 

Its insane how Jackson Dart is HIM (so far) and the second we get a QB we still find ways to lose. 

Remember at the end of last season Daboll said something along the lines of ""This is what happens when we have good QB play""; Whats you're fucking excuse now huh? 

I have been chaotic neutral on the subject of firing Daboll. Truthfully i was okay to just let it play out and i wanted to have patience. However this was officially the final straw. 

The Cowboys, Saints, and Broncos were not just winnable games; we SHOULD HAVE WON THEM. This head coach is failing at his job, and the fact of the matter is we need to bring in someone different. 

This is really frustrating because if we fire Daboll (which we have to), we then have to discuss what to do about Schoen. I'm still on the fence on him as well; though logically i can make the argument in either direction. 

Nonetheless this was literally the worst loss i've ever seen this team endure in my lifetime. We had an opportunity to be the talk of the town; Win 3/4 games with a rookie and no wide-outs against some of the best defenses in the NFL; Look out for the Giants!

Instead its- Same old Giants. 

I'm getting real tired of this. Currently pain level 10 but i might be fading to apathy here real soon. Daboll has to go, Bowen has to go, this roster is actually okay though so i'm on the fence with Schoen. This is such a fucking nightmare someone plz wake me up.

They don't care about you, and until they get a Commanders-style shakeup, this will continue. What infuriates me most is that Bowen clearly has the ability to call good games but he just enters self-destruct mode in the fourth quarter. Shutting Denver out in three quarters was impressive and yet managed to allow 33 points in one quarter. It just beggars belief. He gets in his own head and switches it up to prevent defense. How about sticking with the game plan that has worked all game? How about playing the team's strengths and Rush the passer instead of dropping everyone back into coverage?

As for the Kicker, if he sees the field again on Sunday there will be a lot of Boos coming his way. For the love of God sign anyone else. Missing mid length FGs I can forgive but chip shot XP? No excuses. It's so unfair that the Cowboys get to enjoy Mr automatic 60+ yard kicking machine, whilst we are stuck with someone incapable of even being somewhat average.",360211.0,neutral

They don't care about you, and until they get a Commanders-style shakeup, this will continue. Daboll will be gone at season’s end.   The only question is if Schoen survives.  A HC’s job is to position players for success, and to help them develop.  So many players leaving Daboll and going on to success elsewhere very quickly tells you he is well-below average at those tasks.  His entire reputation was based on his work with Josh Allen, who is a generational, hall of game type talent, with a great front office that gave him overwhelming talent.  A lot of guys would look good in that context.  We’ve seen Daboll botch basic game day management and decisions for 3 years.",360211.0,neutral

His point is that Dart is a rookie and you have to protect him from Rookie mistakes.  He made a big rookie mistake, but it’s also a situation the coach shouldn’t have put him in the first place.

That being said, this team clearly loves and believes in Dart.  Since he’s been put in the starting role you can see the team rally around him in a way we haven’t seen in a long time.  There’s something to be said for that.",23905.0,negative
