No matter what atrocities or depressing things are happening in the world, I always get a nice sense of relief and satisfaction in knowing that the NY Jets always suck ass. I started thinking about what it must be like to be a Jets fan, who are four generations removed from a Super Bowl win. Here are some things that put this in perspective:

* The moon landing happened in 1969 after their Super Bowl win earlier that year.

* The Beatles (who were still around) broke up.

* The Vietnam War ended.

* Star Wars premiered and 11 more SW films have come out since then

* ALL OF THE SIMPSONS has aired

* MTV launched and no longer plays music videos

* The internet was created.

* We've seen floppy disks, cassette tapes, VHS, CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray.

* The first mobile phone call was made.

* The Watergate scandal happened and Nixon reisgned.

* The PC was invented.

* Blockbuster came and went.

* The Soviet Union collapsed.

* GPS was invented

* 9/11 happened and the Iraq War started and ended

* social media was invented

* The human genome was sequenced

* smartphones were invented

* Tom Brady was born, played 23 seasons, won seven Super Bowls, retired twice, and is already in a broadcast booth.

* Gen X, Millennials, Gen Z, and Gen Alpha have all been born

* The world population has increased 2.5x.

* The Department of Education didn't even exist yet.

* Amtrak didn't exist.

* Walmart was a tiny regional chain with fewer than 30 stores.

* The entire careers of Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston, Prince, David Bowie, and Kobe Bryant all started and ended.

But people forget just how absolutely dreadful the offensive line was last year. Vederian Lowe (how is he still on the team?) might have been the single worst starting left tackle I've seen on the Patriots in my three decades of watching the team. 

Now, I obviously would love to see the team target a stud receiver in the first round next year because I'm not sure how much Diggs will have left in the tank and, if we're being honest, he's much more of an above-average possession guy at this point in his career than a true game-changer.

But for me, left tackle was just the position where you could not simply stand pat given the free agent options available. Will Campbell was the right pick.",31434.0,neutral

He played a lot of snaps last game and I don’t think registered a catch. We have a crowded receiver room and it could be, he’s just not getting enough practice reps with Drake.

However, that changed this week. Vrabel even said this is his opportunity. With Boutte out of the way, it opened it up for him to get more reps, especially if he’s going into the game as the starting X. 

Will Kyle use this opportunity to start the process of winning the X away from Boutte, or will he fade away and become another Patriots receiver bust, he will answer us with ability this Sunday.

* **The Patriots still won.** It was close. It came down to a missed field goal. But New England 100 percent loses this game the past 3-to-4 seasons. 
* **Maye was on a QB rating streak that was approaching unprecedented in league-wide terms** (it was already unprecedented for the Patriots). Some kind of come-down was inevitable.
* **While he isn't a rookie, in many ways, Maye might as well be one.** Very few STAR (as in, true, turns-out-to-be-great) rookie quarterbacks experience a complete coaching flip after a single season. Maye didn't just have the rug pulled out from him last offseason - they removed the whole floor. He has spent the last 4 months essentially relearning his position from the basement.
* **S-Tier QBs still occasionally cost teams games** (not that the Pats lost). Tom Brady (rarely) made game-losing mistakes. Patrick Mahomes *definitely* has cost the Chiefs games. Errors - big errors - happen to everyone.
* **Even if Drake Maye turned out in the long run to be another Aaron Rodgers** (so, not S-tier, but high A-tier \[and I'm not saying he is - I'm just throwing out the 'what if'\]), **nobody in this fanbase should be anything but jubilant.** Do you realize how rarefied even that air is? There are franchises that go 30-40 years without seeing a QB of that skill level pass through their system. Look at the Bears. Look at the Jets.

I'm a very driven person. Went to a world-class conservatory and I make a living as a professional classical musician. It's an extremely high-pressure, high-competition environment, and in my teens and twenties I had basically no life. Didn't watch TV shows, didn't play video games, didn't read non-music books, didn't really do much other than practice, gig, teach, and work out. I also got divorced from my first wife partially as a result, and I am now awaiting my first child at nearly 40 years of age.

This is the literal GOAT of the NFL, one of the most competitive people to have lived in the modern age, and *even he* understands that the one thing you don't get back is time with your family. It's sad seeing a hero tortured like this, but it's such an important lesson on what is really important.

 We swiped him from the Giants' with a waiver claim when they tried to stash him on their practice squad. We were not the only team that made a claim, either. It's tough to find QBs with starting experience. He's a promising backup that may be on the team for years to come.

 On a somewhat related note, I wish they would increase the roster to 55 and have the active roster be 50 with the caveat that teams have to have 3 active QBs or else they can only have 49 guys on the active roster.

It doesn't make sense to me that the practice squad is 17 players but the active roster is only 53. IMO a practice squad of 15 with an active roster of 55 would make more sense and give more players an opportunity.",53834.0,neutral

Same goes for the Chiefs, although they’ve at least falling to where they belong in the last week or two in a lot of rankings that I’ve read.

 Hey Gronk and Jules!! Love you both and appreciate all the hard work you did to bring championships to the New England fanbase. A couple questions:

Can you tell the McCourty twins apart when they are wearing the same clothes?

What loss left the most bitter taste to you guys and to the locker room? Super Bowl against the Eagles? the loss to Denver in the AFCCG?

Gronk, did you notice a change in how Tom ran the offense going from New England to Tampa Bay? How much did the transition from McDaniels to the Leftwich/Arians offense change Tom's game?",31526754.0,positive

2015: Jaguars 5-11

""Oh no, I don’t even know what show he’s on,"" Maye said, when asked about the comments during his weekly appearance on 'WEEI Afternoons.' ""I think they get paid to make remarks and make certain comments. So, I just worry about what people in our organization think, and worry about we think and what my teammates think. People are going to have different opinions. I’m just going out there on Sunday and worrying about ourselves.""

You really have to be reaching to take that first line out of context and turn it into some dramatic thing.

Lmao all of these shows are former athletes dunking on the younger generation stars. I know it’s a schtick but it’s still hilarious to see Steven A get so self righteous on behalf of Cam Newton. 

If Cam actually watched the games and looked into stats instead of parroting “herpaderp easily schedule” then maybe he could come up with a better take.  Instead he just sounds like another hater. But it works, because ESPN is getting clicks and talking points from it.

Nonetheless, he now has a spot. Whether he keeps it is up to him, but this is why he stayed. The opportunity ahead of him was more available to him here.

But Maye isn’t letting Newton — who the quarterback has cited as someone he looked up to growing up — take up space in his head.

“I don’t even know what show he’s on,” Maye said during his weekly appearance on WEEI. ""I think they get paid to make remarks and make certain comments. So, I just worry about what people in our organization think, and worry about we think and what my teammates think. People are going to have different opinions. I’m just going out there on Sunday and worrying about ourselves.”

Newton’s biggest issue has been the Patriots playing “sorry scrubs” week after week, negating the fact New England beat the Buffalo Bills and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on the road.

While the schedule is statistically one of the easiest in the NFL, it’s not something the Patriots have any control over.

“I can only coach one team at a time. I don’t make the schedule. Every team beats every (team),” coach Mike Vrabel said recently on WEEI.. “That’s just mind-boggling to me, in the National Football League, that there be strength of schedule. You got a salary cap. Everybody spends the same amount of money. So you guys know in this league, that that doesn’t really mean anything.”

Newton has also taken issue with Maye being referred to as a top-five quarterback, noting he wants to see the second-year quarterback play consistently against “well and capable” competition.

Maye’s play this year — despite what some may say about the schedule — has put him in the MVP conversation. His 2,836 yards this season ranks first in the NFL, and his 73.2 QBR is second.

The record of the Patriots' opponents  will probably end up below .400.  It is absolutely natural, as a former MVP quarterback, to say ""this team hasn't beaten anyone, so who knows how good they are,"" and also to speculate that if we faced the Rams right now, we might face problems we aren't facing against the Jets.  

But it is also natural for Maye to say ""I've beaten whoever (whomever?) is in front of me.""  He isn't making his own case for MVP, or that the Patriots should be high in the power rankings, he's just making his case that the team keeps winning games.  None of us know how the Patriots would hold up against a difficult schedule, nor whether we can roll through Denver or Indy or KC the way we have rolled through a slew of uncompetitive teams.

I gotta say though that humans are so funny when it comes to correlation vs causation. 

I would LOVE to see a SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE skit where people are in a room and like a coin is being repeatedly flipped to determine for some good/bad consequence. And each person thinks that some silly unrelated  factor is controlling the outcome.

‘It was HEADS right after Jenny put her baseball cap on! Jenny put it back on! And Bob, try standing on one foot again!’

By the end the skit would have all the characters doing ridiculous things in an attempt to influence the coin flip. 

Then again, we do already kind of see this at baseball games- mostly when fans think wearing their baseball cap in funny ways will result in that big strikeout or home run.",15898.0,neutral

By Ben Volin

The 2025 season has been an unexpected treat in New England.

The Patriots are 9-2, already more than double the wins from last year’s four. Second-year quarterback Drake Maye is the favorite to win MVP. Mike Vrabel, fired by the Titans two years ago, is the favorite to win Coach of the Year. Owner Robert Kraft has had the Midas touch, with every move this offseason turning to gold.

But the season has to be especially gratifying for two people who took more than their share of grief the last few years: Offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels, and Eliot Wolf, the executive vice president of player personnel.

Neither has been too popular with fans and media. [*Why did Jerod Mayo lose his job but Eliot Wolf kept his?*](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/01/06/sports/on-football-patriots-eliot-wolf-robert-kraft/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link) a certain Globe writer questioned in January after the Patriots floundered to their second straight 4-13 season. And McDaniels’s hiring in January to run the Patriots offense again came with plenty of criticism. *McDaniels is a retread, a product of Tom Brady, and doesn’t connect with players, and his offense is outdated.*

Yet both have been integral pieces to the Patriots record and deserve their due. Wolf is batting close to 1.000 this year with the team’s offseason moves, a total reversal from 2024 when almost nothing went right. And McDaniels’s return to Foxborough has been a slam dunk, home run, an 80-yard touchdown, and any other sports cliché available.

“I have to give a lot of credit to Josh McDaniels,” Kraft said Thursday night on the 98.5 pregame show. “I think he understands Drake and how he operates and adapting him into the culture of whomever we’re playing the next week, looking at their weaknesses where we hopefully can exploit it. They’ve developed a great chemistry.”

McDaniels got crushed in 2023 when the Raiders fired him less than two full seasons into a five-year deal as coach. Raiders fans celebrated the news, pundits wrote him off, and his players smoked cigars in the locker room in their first game without him.

It’s true McDaniels might be better suited as a coordinator than head coach, but he is still quieting the other doubters this season. The Patriots have improved from 30th in points last year to seventh this year, while Maye has become one of the most explosive down-field passers in the NFL.

Every aspect of the Patriots offense has improved dramatically compared to the last few years — from the performance of the offensive line, to the receivers’ ability to get open, to the quarterback’s ability to find the right receiver. Maye deserves the most credit for the team’s success, but McDaniels is No. 2 for putting the pieces in position to succeed.

It should make even the most ardent McDaniels haters re-evalute their perspective on him as a coach, and particularly his time with the Raiders in 2022-23. McDaniels will be the first to admit that he did not handle his Broncos stint well 15 years ago and was not emotionally ready for the job. But he gets a bad rap for his Raiders tenure, in which he went 11-17.",335470.0,positive

1p0fc48,1763499604.0,209,0.96,151,Discussion,"Once maligned, Josh McDaniels and Eliot Wolf have been integral to the Patriots’ success this season  This sub consistently focuses too much on Wolff's misses on Day 2 and underrates Wolff's vet signings, trades, draft picks on Days 1 & 3, and overall cap management. 

**Great value vet contracts** (I'm crediting Vrabel for the former Titans signings): 

* Jaylinn Hawkins is graded as 6th best safety in the league per PFF on a 1-yr $1.8m contract. 
* Corey Durden is graded as the 11th best DI in the league per PFF on a 2-yr, $2.1m contract. 
* Tonga is graded as 30th best DI @ 1-yr, $2.1m
* Moses is playing as an average tackle @ only 3-yrs, $24m and Bradbury is fine @ 2-yr, $9.5m. These deals helped us transform the o-line from horrendous to serviceable for very cheap. Crucially, Wolff didn't *overpay* for mediocre talent e.g. Titans gave Dan Moore 4-yrs @ $80m for similar play. 

**Trades.** Wolff has consistently gotten value out of players that we were going to cut or let walk. He turned Milton, Dugger, Polk, Godchaux, White, Jones, Uche into a 5th round pick and 5x 6th round picks. I like that he moved on quickly from his failed picks (Polk, Baker), got value for players we were going to cut (Uche, White, Milton, Jones), and shed some bloated contracts (Dugger, Godchaux).*

**Cap management.** We are projected to have the 10th most cap space in the league next year, and the large majority of our dead cap is attached to players that are performing. Wolff built in outs after next season in all four of the major contracts we signed with older vets (Davis, Diggs, Landry, and Williams), timed perfectly for extensions with Gonzo and Maye). 

**Drafting.** It's true that Wolff is at minimum partially responsible for poor Day 2 picks, but he has been fairly good on Days 1 and 3. 

* **Day 1** Wolff gets some blame for missing on Strange in '22 and some credit for hitting on Gonzo in '23. He gets all the credit for taking Maye in '24 and passing on offers to move back. He gets at least some credit for hitting on Campbell this year. 

* **Day 2.** This is Wolff's worst day, but it's not as bad as some make it out to be. Many players that people say we 'missed' on are solid starters on other teams. To me, this indicates some blame lies with the coaching staff. Day 2 of '22 was OK: Marcus Jones is good. Tyquan Thornton, Jack Jones, and Zappe are all solid contributors on other teams, Pierre Strong is still in the league. Day 2 of '23 was poor: Mapu is decent, White and Andrews were JAGs but are still playing, Sow was a bust and Ryland in the 4th was awful. Day 2 in '24 is the only abject failure: Polk, Robinson, Baker all flamed out, and Wallace is just a backup tackle. But Day 2 in '25 looks at least decent (solid picks in Henderson and Woodson) and will be excellent if one of Farmer or Williams can develop into at least an average starter. 

* **Day 3.** Wolff has helped us find great value in Day 3 since '22, hitting on 7 out of 18 picks in Douglas, Boutte, Borregales, Baringer, Milton, Bryant and Swinson. Plus he has a good track record with UDFAs. We are getting meaningful snaps each game from Brendan Schooler, Elijah Ponder, Dell Pettus, and Efton Chism.",30497.0,negative

Yes, Allen did great...after completely crapping out and putting his team in a bad spot. That first interception - good grief. If Tampa had been focused and on task offensively, that would've been an entirely different game. Did he play well? For enough of the time, yes. Still, 2 interceptions and 63% passing demonstrates he wasn't entirely on his game.

It was the same when the Pats played the Bucs. I don't feel as though Maye had a wonderful game, but all the talking heads were expounding on the marvelous job he did. Seriously, when an NFL QB in 2025 throws at a 52% clip (not even!), he didn't have the best game.

Give Allen his due, he's a great QB. But even great QB's have days where it's kinda hit or miss - he managed to have both. Same with Maye, he's showing that he can be a great QB, but that doesn't mean he's beyond criticism.

1oznei8,1763402734.0,17670,0.99,152,News,"Mike Vrabel responds to Cam Newton’s ‘fool’s gold’ comment about Patriots success  From MassLive's story: Cam Newton has been tough on the Patriots this season and called their success “fool’s gold” due to their strength of schedule.

Back when Mike Vrabel was playing for the Patriots, then-coach Bill Belichick might take some negative attention the team was getting and use it as motivation. But Vrabel, now that he’s a coach, doesn’t want to do things that way.

“What are we gonna do put Cam Newton clips up there?,” Vrabel said during his weekly appearance on WEEI. “We’d rather put our clips or the Bengals clips. I don’t think that’s even remotely close to how we should inspire our players to play better.”

Vrabel noted what Newton said wasn’t offensive.

“Nothing’s weird to me, because people can come on the radio or, you know what I mean?” Vrabel said. “It’s just (saying) things that get their attention. We are OK with that. I promise you, we were OK with it. Anything that anybody says, we are going to come to work. We’re going to focus on us. We’re going to try to improve, and we’re going to focus on the Bengals and going on the road, trying to get our 10th win. That’s all we’re going to focus on.

“Whatever it is, people are gonna have something to say which is great,” he later added. “They’re entitled to their opinion. What’s most important is what we do here and how we work.”

The Patriots are 9-2 and sit atop the AFC East standings. They’ve also won eight games in a row and have the 3-7 Cincinnati Bengals in Week 12.

Without fully seeing what Cam said, these are my thoughts on 2025, expectations, etc.

This season has been absolutely marvelous. It's the greatest surprise since 2001 in that the expectations were below zero. They have double the wins the most negative of us predicted. 

Do I think they win out? No.

Do I think they lose out? No.

Do I think they win the SB? No.

Do I think they lose in the first round? Depends on their first game.

The one thing I am hanging my hat on is that Drake Maye is the MVP of the league. That, to me, is not up for debate. Sure, there is a conversation to be made across the league, but from what I have seen, that is fact.

I also believe that if the superbowl was next week, the Pats probably win.

But I probably also agree that the Pats are playing a little over their skis right now, much like 2021 before the Indy game. I think the next few weeks will tell us the truth. Just...try to see the forest for the trees. The Pats are back on the right path. If they don't win the SB this year, it isn't a failure. They have already WON. They are a tough out, they can put up 30 on anyone. They are to be respected and their QB is on the way to being feared.

That said, I dont think Cam's comment is that outlandish here. This is a relatively untested up and coming team. There's nothing wrong with limiting expectations until we see what theyre made of in the playoffs.

Personally I disagree with Cam, but that probably has more to do with the general unimpressiveness of the AFC than it does with the Patriots.

I wanted the team to start from scratch with a completely new era.

That said, I am so insanely happy to be wrong. I am seeing Vrabel be a good coach, work with McDaniels to develop Maye into a top QB in the league in only his second year, and turn the team into legitimate AFC contenders in year one.

If there isn't a QB who's that special (like Drake Maye), roster first. 

I'm also glad we didn't build the team first BECAUSE Drake was there. It is absolutely not the one-size-fits-all optimal team building strategy. IMO team first is usually best if you don't have the chance to pick a QB who's generationally special.",115056.0,neutral

This is so dumb. We got lucky as hell, but we’ve also been building the team before we had a franchise qb. 

Look at Denver. They still don’t have a franchise qb, but they built an incredibly strong team that has a mediocre qb with the same record as us.

Go look at Indy who built one of the best offensive lines with one of the best rbs in the league and a pretty mediocre qb and they have the same record as us. I understand Jones is having good numbers, but I am still in belief that is because of everything around him and not him elevating others. ",230112.0,positive

You do it how the draft falls to you. Lets say Drake Maye was not available in 2024.   At our draft position. Would we force a JJ McCarthy or Nix at 3 or take Joe Alt. Id take Alt. 

Maybe also an edge rusher here too. After that I can see taking JJ or Nix so a QB. And maybe since he was projected Marvin Harrison (without benefit of hindsight from his nfl time)

Still beat the bucs and bills, other supposed contenders. Lots of SB winners had easy schedules. Helps get the first round bye of course.

None of this matters. We are still 9-2 and making it to the playoffs. The team is coming together, the future is bright and fuck it, who knows what'll happen. We will have the easiest path to the SB.

Seems the players are being treated more like baseball hitting slumps when they are not playing well. Stevenson’s fumbles were getting past the point of excusable and the coach encouraged him and let him play through it.

Borregales had a rough initial outing, but was picked after training camp for a reason. Coach didn’t panic, was encouraging, and he settled down and performed how the coaches believed he could.

Henderson just got his opportunities, coach showed he believed in him with majority role and he rose to the challenge. We have good coaches coaching up players they believe in. The players are believing in themselves and playing up to their potential.",21711.0,positive

He may even get better. He is still a boy. He will get bigger and stronger and smarter. A+++ draft pick.  An eighth if an inch below what was perceived to be the absolute bottom. He also has a particularly short reach thanks to narrow shoulders.   Pretty significant.  


It was a valid concern and will be a valid concern the next time an OT comes out with a short reach. But like a slow 40, short stature, or any other subpar metrics, that's just one piece of the puzzle.  That shit absolutely matters, but it isn't always the dealbreaker people make it out to be.  It often is, but sometimes players thrive despite it.  


It was blown out of proportion, but the conversation rarely was ""here's the traits he has that can make his short reach not an issue"" or ""here is how a short reach is detrimental to the NFL success of an OT"". It was tons of lazy takes acting like it was all that mattered or that people are stupid for thinking it was remotely relevant.  ",174802.0,negative

 I honestly think this is such a good oppurtunity for Josh to grow outside of Bill. The big issue for Josh with the Raiders and Broncos was how he treated the players.

 You can already hear the subtle narrative changing from “he will never get another HC job” to “he probably won’t , but maybe”. I think it’s Josh’s dream that he becomes a successful HC someday, so if he’s given the opportunity, I think he would take it. I think every opportunity he has had, the QB situation ranged from  bad to very bad.

VRABEL, VRABEL, VRABEL, VRABEL!!  I’ve followed football less once I left my fantasy league, but a couple years ago in Madden (22 I think?), I decided to pair up teams and have all the good players from both go to one team and all the bad players go to the other (and also some of the bad teams got renamed and relocated). The Titans were one of the bad teams and Belichick (somewhat famously) wasn’t in Madden so I sent his NPC replacement to the Titans and sent Vrabel to be the Pats coach (solely because he used to be on the team).

I tried to thank him for stopping, but before I finished he hit me with this soft “shhhh” and held up one finger like he was listening for distant wildlife or something. Then he nodded to himself and said, “the battery is speaking,” and started setting up the jumper cables—barefoot the whole time like that was just his default setting.

At one point he asked me to pop the hood, then asked again immediately, just to “confirm synchronicity.” When the engine finally turned over, he clapped once—super loud—and said “rebirth.” Then he handed me a pine cone from his pocket “for luck,” gave a little wink, and jogged off toward the stadium like that was the most normal exchange in the world.",25113037.0,positive

No, don't draft, don't try to do anything else, you already have enough playground to be brilliant.

The way this offense is working during one single season back... he came up with such a spectacular playbook that is using the best way the tools at his disposal so efficiently, in such a short manner of time, he's literally helping Drake becoming a superstar.

Vrabel does not take another job and ends up here after being free for a year. 

Josh after 2 failed HC stops is not going to be a HC candidate for a couple of years. Loves it here and is a great OC. Him teaching Drake all of his stuff for a few years is going to be a major impact on him.

We have a bunch of good young players who will most likely become expensive if they pan out the way we want them to (Maye, Campbell, Gonzo, Henderson to name a few) and we are better served in the long term building through the draft and free agency right now.

Look for that home run deal that takes us over the edge when we are back to being capital C contenders again.

The rankings factored in team performance, ticket prices, fan engagement, and the strength of local sports culture.  I think what helps compared to other big markets is Boston/NE really only has one team for each of the big 4 sports. So it's not like there is just a majority of fans for those teams, it's a super majority so everyone lives and dies by the same team successes.

I live in NJ and while sports are big here, fans are split since both the Philly and NY market shares the area, and even then the NYC market has multiple teams of the same sport so fandom is all over. I suppose CT is the oddball for NE in that regards but it's not quite the same extreme as I see in Jersey.

You look at other big metro areas and there's a split because there are multiple teams in the same league - Chicago, LA, San Fran (Because you had Oakland teams for a while). Other states have multiple teams - Florida, Texas, Ohio that may split fans.

To me, Boston/NE has the most unified sports fandom in the country because they have one team per sport, such a big range/population, and generational fandom.",101146.0,neutral

WalletHub analyst Chip Lupo said Boston earned the number-one ranking because of its wide appreciation for different sports, professional presence, and famous venues. “Boston tops the list of the best sports cities this year because of its strong appreciation for all types of sports, numerous professional teams, and proximity to iconic stadiums and arenas,” he said. “It ranks second for basketball and maintains impressive standings in baseball, football, and soccer.”

> The city’s sports identity runs deep, built on both triumph and heartbreak that have defined its teams for decades. Few cities can match the passion of Boston’s fandom. Whether cheering the Celtics, Bruins, Patriots, Red Sox, or Revolution, locals have a team for every season and a story that ties generations together.

> Alfred C. Yen, a professor at Boston College Law School, said what makes Boston special is the connection between the city, its teams, and the people who root for them. “A good sports city starts with its fans,” Yen said. “When a personal relationship develops between the city, the fans, and the teams, the support becomes almost like family.”

I love this team and it’s insanely awesome what Drake has managed to do 10 games into his sophomore season, but this hyperbolic “how are we so lucky” talk feels a little disingenuous. All it’s going to take is a poor game or two for a zillion engagement bait articles wondering if he’s overrated and actually not the guy, and he may indeed have to go through some struggles before he levels up or levels down.

He’s a talented player in really impressive form at the moment - let’s just acknowledge form as a temporary indicator of *possible* excellence before we start praising god for his gifts.",2012.0,negative

It's not technically a compliment here, because Haskell was a character who was known for being a sycophant around adults, but devious when they weren't. In my mind, small and cluttered as it might be, it's gonna take the rest of the year to see if he's mvp caliber. If he comes back from last weeks low completion percentage, and goes 23 of 28 for 275 yards or something, that goes a ways. I think with his accuracy he definitely has a shot. And they keep winning of course.",2012.0,positive

1ovdgfc,1762972829.0,20650,0.98,8,News,"Rob Gronkowski signs 1-day contract with Patriots to fulfill late friend’s wish  From MassLive's story: Rob Gronkowski hasn’t played in the NFL in four years, but he’s always wanted to end his career where it began.

The three-time Patriots Super Bowl champion hoped to sign a 1-day contract with the organization before entering the team’s Hall of Fame. Instead, those plans changed to honor his longtime friend, Susan Hurley.

Hurley passed away on Nov. 1 after a battle with ovarian cancer. The local philanthropist told Gronkowski this summer, while the tight end unveiled a new playground in Boston, she hoped he’d sign a 1-day contract to retire as a Patriot.

On Wednesday, Gronkowski granted his friend’s wish.

“We are 100% here today for her,” Gronkowski said. “No doubt about that... When I first met her and she gave me the opportunity to get bibs to the Boston Marathon and the opportunity to raise money for my foundation, I knew that she was the one... She did an excellent job when working with her for 10 plus years. She made it easy. She ran all the activities, all the events, and she will have a lasting impact forever.”

From 2010 to 2018, Gronkowski transformed the tight end position in New England and throughout the NFL. A five-time Pro Bowler, he also earned first-team All-Pro honors four times and was the 2014 NFL Comeback Player of the Year.

At 6-foot-6, 265 pounds, Gronkowski had an otherworldly skill set that made him an impossible player to cover for opposing defenses. The tight end was too big for cornerbacks and too fast for linebackers and safeties.

A member of the Patriots All-2010a Team and All-Dynasty Team, Gronkowski is eligible for the team’s Hall of Fame next year.

“Today we’re going to celebrate one of the greatest ever to wear our Patriots uniform, Rob Gronkowski,” Patriots owner Robert Kraft said. “His energy, talent, and infectious joy lit up the stadium and inspired Patriots Nation for nearly a decade. Like fans everywhere, I personally love Gronk and I treasure the unforgettable moments we shared.”

I was on team Trade Down to 20 ish and Take Egbuka pre-draft, or at least, I thought it would be a good option. That said, Will Campbell has been the right pick IMO. Our record is in no small part due to him being, at the bare minimum, a serviceable LT in the league. I think the future is bright for him, but at worst (he stays the exact same as he is now), we know that he is not a liability and this can be a playoff team with him.

  
I love Egbuka but frankly I don't think we need him. Josh's offense has notoriously spread the wealth around and made do with a team of WR2s, and I like what we have as a ""core"" with Boutte, Diggs (long term will need a replacement), Kyle Williams if he keeps playing like he did this week, and ancillary pieces like Pop Douglas and Mack Hollins. Clearly it's working.

  
At this point in time, I'd rather an Edge, CB, LB, or maybe RT or LG in the draft over a WR. I made a post yesterday about Sonny Styles (would be shocked if he even makes it to our projected pick) as a good LB fit, and I think that would be the best thing to do in our position.

Campbell was a fantastic draft pick and I think that he's the most important recent pick outside of Maye. If we don't pick Campbell and get Egbuka instead, Maye turns into the next Joe Burrow and is hurt all the time; we have a pissed of WR rookie in Egbuka that's good but isn't able to make plays because the QB doesn't have time to throw. Then we trade Egbuka away in 2 seasons and he pops the fuck off in Miami or something.
 

Nah chief, I'm good with Big Country.

But for me, left tackle was just the position where you could not simply stand pat given the free agent options available. Will Campbell was the right pick.

But for me, left tackle was just the position where you could not simply stand pat given the free agent options available. Will Campbell was the right pick. I mean lineman are generally the safer bet and if you’re building a team back you better start on both lines of the ball. So yeah a lineman to protect your young qb is a fine pick. A star wide receiver has way more risk for multiple reasons but also greater upside. I still personally think a stud LT is a better pick than a stud WR. Campbell has been good but he’s definitely not elite/stud shutdown guy. He is good enough to be happy with the pick.

Nothing the NFL and the 31 other teams tried that season was going to stop the GOAT - all in one picture.

He’s clearly still learning. While obviously the last game was huge keep in mind that basically all of his yardage came from two explosive runs. 

I think he’s still struggling adjusting to a McDaniels offense that asks a LOT from the running backs. I see him still struggling to make reads quickly to find the right gaps. That said, that’s very coach able. And obviously we’ve seen that if he gets open space he’s just gone. Seems to me that Vrabel is trying to build a much speedier Patriots offense than what we’ve seen before. 

It’s also worth noting that TreVeyon is coming from a college offense that did maybe a few under center snaps per game, to one of the biggest under center teams in the league, which changes EVERYTHING schematically.",40705.0,positive

Let's lock in, Dynasty reloading. I had them 7-2 going into last week because our schedule was weak. Lost to a couple teams we should have beat and beat a couple teams I didn't have us beating.

The Bucs game was a game changer for expectations because the second half is where the schedule gets dicey. They still have a lot to improve and are weak in key areas that might kill us in the playoffs.


Jets and Dolphins games are going to keep us on our toes, Bengals game is going to test the defense, and the Buffalo & Baltimore games back to back is going to test if we're actually ready to be contenders.",288374.0,positive

By Christopher Price

FOXBOROUGH — Through 10 games, the Patriots have been the best third-quarter team in the NFL.

New England’s 41-point third-quarter point differential (70-29) is tops in the league. The Patriots’ 70 third-quarter points were third-most, trailing only the Colts (72) and Ravens (71), neither of whom can boast the point differential of the Patriots. In all, only three teams have allowed fewer third-quarter points than the Patriots, (Cardinals, Bills, and Rams).

Part of the Patriots’ success can be traced to defensive dominance coming out of halftime. In the third quarter of their last eight games, they have allowed two offensive touchdowns, including one on Sunday against the Buccaneers. Consistently playing with a lead has made the goal of complementary football easier.

But there’s also the value of a fast start on offense to open the third quarter. During their current seven-game winning streak, the Patriots have put points on the board in every one of their first possessions of the second half. (In fact, that streak could be eight in a row, if Rhamondre Stevenson had not fumbled near the goal line against the Steelers.)

New England has used several offensive approaches. There have been long, steady sequences where the Patriots have worked to impose their will. Against the Falcons, the Patriots opened the second half with a 15-play drive — tying a season high for most plays on a scoring drive — to take a 10-point lead.

The Patriots also have ripped off some coldly efficient third-quarter drives [on the strength of quarterback Drake Maye](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/11/09/sports/patriots-buccaneers/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link), whose third-quarter completion rate (78 percent) is his best. Wide receiver Stefon Diggs has more catches and receiving yards in the third quarter this season (20-241) than any other quarter.

And there have been explosive plays. Against the Buccaneers, TreVeyon Henderson delivered a 55-yard touchdown run on the second play from scrimmage to turn a 4-point lead into an 11-point advantage.

What’s the secret behind the Patriots’ third-quarter surge? Coach Mike Vrabel points to a few things.

“\[Sunday\] was a little different just because of the \[explosive\] play,” he said. “I think just trying to get into a rhythm for us is probably always key. Just like a lot of offenses, trying to get into a rhythm and have a flow to you that allows you to mix packages, mix plays, show looks, \[and\] complement looks that you showed. So, I think that’s important.

“Or just hit a big play. That helps too.”

Sunday’s big plays came courtesy of Henderson, a rookie who has taken some time to break out. The second-round pick out of Ohio State, who has spent much of his first year biding his time behind veterans Stevenson and Antonio Gibson, has seen an uptick in reps the last couple of weeks. Against the Buccaneers, he hit a pair of long runs, the 55-yarder, then a 69-yarder that sealed the win.

“It was good to get TreVeyon going a little bit,” center Garrett Bradbury. “We know that we just give him a little crease and he can take it to the house, clearly. So, that was awesome.”",53721.0,neutral

DVOA right now actually has them as below average, EPA/play has them more like bottom of the top 10, FPI has then #14, Nate Silver's ELWAY has them 12th. The problem is the offense is *explosive*, but it's not *efficient*, with the running game being bad and Maye taking too many sacks. The defense also plays a kinda bend-don't-break that can work against teams that can't consistently execute on 3rd down, but if you can they're very gettable (and they're also atrocious in the red zone for some reason).

Now, what does that mean for the future? I'm honestly not sure. They'll be favored in all but two remaining games and maybe even against Buffalo at home, and once you get to the playoffs, who knows what can happen? Some of the problems may even be fixable, it seems like the pass defense is intentionally soft, and the run offense doesn't have any one consistent issue. Drake has certainly showed that he can take fewer sacks. They've got potential to put it all together, but they haven't yet, it just hasn't come back to bite them in the L column since Pittsburgh.",47864.0,positive

There was 1:31 left when he scored, to go up 12. 

Suppose he went down at the 1 yard line instead. The Bucs had 2 TOs left. If we knelt it twice and let the clock run after 3rd down before kicking a FG to go up 8, the Bucs would’ve had ~40 seconds to score a TD & 2 point conversion with no timeouts to tie it. 

That’d be very difficult for them, but since he scored, they had 1:31 & 2 TOs, needing to drive the length of the field, score a TD, get an onside kick recovery, and then score another TD. 

That 2nd scenario (how it actually played out) is/was harder on the Bucs IMO.",58098.0,positive

I'm willing to admit that the right thing to do was to go down but he's a young player and was certainly looking to the sidelines.   He said in an interview later that he couldn't find a coach on the sideline so he ran in the TD. 

If he didn't know to go down, on the 1, then that's a coaching preparedness issue, not an issue with the player. Savvy veteran might have already contemplated what they wanted to do beforehand but with a rookie, it's on the coaches to make sure he's prepped for those eventualities.   Hard to expect Henderson to be doing the clock math while he's got the ball in his hand.

A lot of his sacks have come from him, pulling the ball down and dropping his eyes and looking for a running lane as opposed to just keeping his eyes down the field. If he works on that, he could be absolutely deadly. Many times where he brought his eyes back down, his receivers got open because the defenders know he’s going to run if he can somehow work that into his game, ie purposely bring his eyes down to make the defense bite, then bring them back up and find the open receiver, he can really put some hurt on defenses who believe they have studied enough tape. “oh if he pulls the ball down and brings his eyes down, that means he’s going to run so swarm to the ball.” That’s going to set up defenses for a very painful 60 yard TD.

I play receiver - I should catch the ball.”  The last two onside kicks we've fielded have been flawless kicks by the kicker, where the ball spikes up into the air right around 8 yards, making it extremely difficult to field.  You don't want to try to grab it before 10 yards, but fielding it after 10 yards is also really hard. 

I wonder if it would be worth having someone on the fielding team run up and try to swat the ball backwards.  A bouncing ball is hard to catch cleanly, but probably easier to just swat backwards 5-10 yards where there are only Pats players.",1180480.0,positive

This team is full of gamers though man. If someone doesn’t make a play, someone else somewhere does and they find ways to win. That’s what good teams do and this is a GOOD team.",141310818.0,positive

Taking a knee at the goalline to then get bailed out by maye and diggs. But you dont even need to take a knee if you hadnt rushed to the line to get a play off before the 2 minute for no reason. 2 plays before the knee they hit a 1st down with 2:35 at the like 12 yard line and then rushed to get another play off for no reason. Then did some dumb shit to make up for that bad clock management. Glad we got two guys who can bail us out but man that was ass,4080.0,neutral

1osslxu,1762808000.0,240,0.99,15,Memes,"Vrabel running clock on 1st and goal  I don't hate the decision. By kneeling on first down, you are almost completely removing the opportunity for the Bucs to get the ball and score a fg before the end of the half. Worst case, if you scored on first down, the bucs would have had 1:40 remaining, with no timeouts. Most good teams can score at least a field goal in that situation at least 50% of the time meaning those 7 pts, are now only 4. Now as we know, some teams can score with even less time on the clock (Bills and Chiefs) so I think it is also good practice to effectively have the clock at 0. The only thing I question is going for it on 4th. You already removed the 3 points from a bucs field goal, and unfortunately you didn't score your TD on 2nd and 3rd. I'd have probably just taken the 3 there (a 6 pt swing) and gone into the half with momentum. Obviously it ended up working out, so it's hard to criticize, but I don't think people should have their attention on the 1st down decision as much as the 4th.",3802.0,neutral

Drake Maye at year 2 is way better than Baker at his 2nd year. Idc about coaches and shit. It’s just true. The sophomore leap is just so huge.

 It's a huge test for the offense and OL.   ***Todd Bowles loves to blitz***. The Buccaneers defense has never dropped lower than third in Blitz Rate.

How Drake, the OL and scheme Josh creates to counter this IS the game.  I think it will be a tough matchup.

 It's the NFL.  It's easy to get excited about huge wins and uneasy with tight wins, but ultimately margin doesn't matter. It's about wins and losses.  Every great team has shitty wins.

 Not saying I’m super confident or anything, but this feels like a game we actually should win. I feel like we match up extremely well into this injured version of the Bucs. Only one good receiver is playing, and we have Gonzalez to cover him. The starting RB is out, and our run defense is already stifling even the best ground games. Tampa’s defense is great against the run, but weaker against the pass, which happens to coincide with our strengths on offense. 

Anything could happen, and playing a good team off a bye week in their home stadium is always hard, but honestly this feels like a game where we have most of the matchup advantages.",47606.0,neutral

edit: i wasn’t expecting this many replies, you guys are awesome 🙌 , time for me to expand my patriots knowledge  Well, the team was formed in 1960 and chose the name Patriots as homage to the American Revolution when we broke away from you guys. But for some reason, their uniform was red at first, even though that was your color, not ours. The team really wasn't all that good for the first 30 or so years of its existence except for an occasional good year here or there. Then in the 90s, right around the time they changed the uniform color from red to blue, they became good, not great, which set the stage for Tom Brady to join the team in the year 2000 and go on to become the greatest quarterback to ever play the game and win us 6 Super Bowls over 20 years, turning the team from a mediocre after thought to one of the greatest teams ever. It was during this time period that everyone hated us for winning too much. Anyways then we eventually stupidly let Brady leave and win another Super Bowl elsewhere while we got progressively worse for a few years. But now it looks like we have our new quarterback in Drake Maye, and while there will never be another Brady, Maye certainly looks like he can bring us back to the playoffs regularly again.

edit: i wasn’t expecting this many replies, you guys are awesome 🙌 , time for me to expand my patriots knowledge  The Patriots were a hard-luck franchise for decades. Not only had they never won a Super Bowl, they had one of the worst losses in Super Bowl history against the Bears in 1985. In the second game of the 2001 season, star QB Drew Bledsoe was crushed and left the game with an injury (and almost died). He was replaced by some guy named Tom Brady, the 199th pick in the draft two seasons ago (a draft pick so low your odds of even making the team are slim). 

It seemed like another chapter in a string of bad luck. The season was declared over at that point and they were considered to have maybe the worst team in football. But Brady immediately turned the franchise around, they improbably won the Super Bowl as one of the biggest underdogs in history,  and for the next two decades they went on an unprecedented run of success. 

The coach for this stretch, Bill Belichick, was a workaholic mercenary whose expressionless press conferences and savant-like ability to exploit his opponents’ weaknesses led him to be compared to Darth Vadar.

The combination of Brady’s obsessive perfectionism and Belichick’s unparalleled defensive mind led to six Super Bowl victories, tied for most ever, three other appearances, and the only 16-0 season ever. 

The constant winning and some cheating accusations led basically most of football to rally against the Patriots — which made it extra frustrating for them as the Patriots continued to kick the shit out of the league year after year. 

I highly encourage you to look up some games from this era. The Patriots, in many cases, would stage utterly miraculous comebacks and victories so improbable that if you delivered them as movie scripts they would get rejected. They did this regularly. The 28-3 comeback against the Falcons in the 2016 Super Bowl is generally considered the greatest comeback in American sports history — and yet half the Patriots fans on this sub would probably list three other games they preferred to that one. 

Brady left for Tampa in 2020 (and promptly won another Super Bowl, which means he’s won more than any NFL team). The Patriots hit hard times after that for a few years and Belichick was relieved a couple years ago.

Now, though, things are looking up again. They have one of the best records of the NFL behind 23-year-old QB Drake Maye, a happy-go-lucky kid with an incredible arm. Their coach is Mike Vrabel, a former star linebacker from the dynasty years, and they have a number of other exciting players on the team. Everyone is starting to hate us again, which feels right. 

The Patriots play in Foxborough, Massachusetts, which is in the middle of nowhere and a really interesting place to see a game. One of the great things about when they were winning is that they would host teams who played in warmer climates or domes in Foxborough in the middle of a New England winter for night games, where temperatures would often fall below freezing and it sometimes snowed. No opponent ever wants to come face the Patriots — and their fans — at a home game in January.

Got better and made a SB appearance but right after Parcells and Kraft had a falling out which results in him leaving for the Jets and taking Belichick with him. Parcells retires in 2000 and selects Belichick as his heir apparent but Belichick immediately quits to take the job herr. That off-season we draft Tom Brady with the 199th pick. We're bad the first year with Belichick but then in 2001, Bledsoe suffers a serious injury which forces the Pats to put in Brady. Pats immediately go on a run and win that years Super Bowl. We go on to win two more Super Bowls in 2003 and 2004. We then go a decade without winning one before winning three more in 2014, 2016 and 2018 respectively. Brady leaves after 2019 to go to Tampa. We draft Mac Jones in 2021. Jones looks really promising in 2021 but his development is hampered by McDaniels leaving and BB promoting Matt Patricia and Joe Judge to run the offense. We're really bad in 2022 and 2023. Belichick gets fired. We promote Jerod Mayo to be our new HC. We draft Drake Maye. Despite Maye showing a lot of promise, the team is really bad again so we fire Mayo and hire Mike Vrabel. We also bring back McDaniels to be our OC.",158055.0,positive

edit: i wasn’t expecting this many replies, you guys are awesome 🙌 , time for me to expand my patriots knowledge  There's a book called The Dynasty that goes into how the team became what it was from 2001-2019. Highly recommend for getting to know the history of Kraft, how he bought the team, and how he made moves to build the culture. The book doesn't go too far in depth about the games, but it does include the consequences of many big games, both good and bad. 

Do Your Job is an NFL film detailing the teams that won SB 49, 51, and 53. You should be able to find all three on YouTube. Great watches about Bill's strategy and the coaching decisions. For instance, I had no idea the 4 O-Line formation was gameplanned during the bye week in 2014. I thought Bill just told them on the spot to do it. But they had it implemented because Bill saw some teams do something unique, and modified it for their team. 

Friendly reminder that we hate the Jets, Bills, Dolphins, and the Giants. 

My two favorite things about watching the Pats were Tom's genius and Bill's innovation. Tom knew every defense and how to exploit every single advantage he had, big or small. Pats haters would complain constantly about ""dink and dunk"" offense, but Tom knew how to best keep the drive going and took everything the defense gave him. 

Every week that we had an ""impossible"" matchup, Bill always seemed to have an answer, even if unconventional. The man had a whole game plan in place for SB53, and scrapped it to run a 6-1 defensive front. Absolutely insane, but it held a top 3 offense to 3 points. Absolute masterpiece",158055.0,positive

edit: i wasn’t expecting this many replies, you guys are awesome 🙌 , time for me to expand my patriots knowledge  So before you get to team level, I’d highly suggest you learn the basics of football like the more common rules and basic terminology.  You don’t have to get into learning specific plays, but knowing what a play action play is versus 5 wide helps you follow what people say and understand the game better.

As far as patriots, post 1980s, there was basically pre Brady era and notable QB before was Bledsoe.  Then Brady came along.  They also had old stadium then moved to Gillette where what most people know them for now.

There’s lots of great players during Brady runs like notable defensive players - Bruschi, Seymour, Wilfork, Vrabel, Harrison, Law, then offensive talent Brown, Gronk, Edelman, Moss… then ST like Gostkowski and Vinatieri.

But knowing how football is rules, roles/position, and basic strategy/play types and defensive sets, help you as players change but if you are watching the games you will accumulate knowledge.  It’s hard to understand all past history of the team without having lived and watch them at the time, but they used to have season summaries with a guy

None of that is to say that Maye isn’t an amazing QB though, I just think the Bucs need someone very experienced for when things go wrong younger QBs aren’t used to. 

Also Jax probably wouldn’t but tbh that’s bc we haven’t seen what Lawrence under a good coach for a full season looks like. Also Tlaw is pretty big still among Jax fans.",507138.0,neutral

1opcsvu,1762371488.0,22540,0.99,32,Casual,"Rookie safety landed in Boston at 4:30 a.m. to fulfill NFL dream with Patriots  From MassLive's story: John Saunders Jr. was in Miami getting ready for another day on the Dolphins practice squad when his phone rang. Eliot Wolf was on the other end, and he told the rookie safety that the Patriots were signing him to their 53-man roster.

That’s when Saunders had to scramble.

The safety quickly packed a suitcase, got as many belongings together as he could, and went to the airport. He landed in Boston by 4:30 a.m. the next morning. For Saunders, this is a dream come true.

“I’ve never experienced this before. I entered the portal a few years ago, but that, you’ve got days and months before you have to leave,” said Saunders, who signed with the Patriots last week. “This is like I packed my bags, talked to Eliot Wolf the same day, and then at 4:30 in the morning, I was here in Boston. It was crazy, I can’t even explain it. This is different, but it’s a blessing to be able to go from one place to the next and start learning.”

When Saunders walked into Gillette Stadium, it wasn’t his first time in the building.

A standout defensive back at Ole Miss, Saunders took one of his pre-draft visits in Foxborough with the Patriots this past spring. The Patriots liked the athletic safety, who finished with three interceptions last fall.

However, when the draft ended, Saunders became a coveted undrafted free agent and signed a deal with Miami that guaranteed him $120,000. The rookie impressed in training camp, but was cut by the end of August and spent this season on their practice squad.

The Patriots didn’t forget about him. When the team traded Kyle Dugger to the Pittsburgh Steelers last week, they needed to add more depth to their safety position. The next day, they signed Saunders away from Miami.

He said stepping back inside the building was surreal.

“The main thing I remember is when you walk in the player entrance, you’ve got all the Super Bowls right there,” Saunders said. “Then, outside the doors, all the Super Bowl titles. This is football tradition. Serious, rich tradition. Winners. This is the winningest team since I’ve been born. Being a part of this is a blessing. Just excited to help continue this legacy.”

There are so many teams who got more picks and got to nowhere, you guys know about the obvious ones, so how about 49ers a perennially good team with generally competent FO.

A lot of his sacks come from him trying to step up to escape but running straight into the defender. He will learn situational football with time. Trying to escape on 3rd down to get a first down? Makes sense. Trying to escape on first down and 10 in opposition territory? Maybe roll out and throw it away instead.

A perfect example was the strip sack late in the half against the Falcons. It was first down, we are up 14 and we get the ball back to start the second half. He should have rolled out and throw it at the feet of a lineman and live to play another day.",32786.0,neutral

As Brady has quoted Parcells, the best ability is availability. Jayden was always a slight build and a running QB. Everyone knew in the draft he had the risk of injury given his play style and physique. Maye was absolutely seen as a bit safer on the injury front. It’s obvious when you watch the games: he absorbs hits and is harder to bring down so he doesn’t get leveled in the same way.

We are a legit football team and are 1 or 2 impact players away from making a serious run. Pick up the phone Elliot! Here’s my opinion: Pass Rush is still the biggest need, we have not been good at getting to the QB all season and we give opposing QBs way too much time in the pocket. This is one of the things that separate good teams from great teams Good teams are able to play well but great teams are able to prevent the other team from playing well in addition to playing well. 

Another important thing that we may want to look into is Wide receiver. With Kayshon Boutte leaving the game yesterday, it was apparent that not having an X receiver was greatly impacting our ability to make shots deep down the field. If Boutte is going to miss a substantial amount of time (> 6 weeks) We should take a look at receivers who have similar play styles to Boutte or proven X receivers. 

Positions I don’t think are as important as what some others say is RB and Oline. While our run game has been mediocre, it’s unlikely we are going to get a truly significant difference maker for good value that is not a one year rental. Our guys have shown that they can actually run the ball and put up decent yardage. Oline is kind of similar in that you’re not going to get anyone who can truly elevate the oline. One thing teams do not do is trade good offensive linemen especially at the trade deadline. Getting an offensive lineman who can truly elevate the line is either going to be way too expensive, or just isn’t going to happen.",501296.0,positive

In my mind he’s not really the most sacked anyway. A run that gets stopped at the LOS shouldn’t go down as a sack. Even the plays where he’s been chased out of bounds before the LOS get counted as sacks.

IMO, the offensive line needs more refurbishing in the off-season. 

If Moses retires (or his play falls off), RT becomes a NEED. It’s nice to dream Butler develops but it isn’t likely. 

Onwenu makes more money than his production deserves. RG is typically the easiest OL position to draft. 

Wilson moving to Center and Bradberry moving on is likely. LG is a need. 

Campbell has shown enough that he’ll remain the LT until the team stumbles into a better LT via late round pick or UDFA. Good enough, not “franchise”. 

Basically, I think we have to draft at least two OL if not three. Wilson and Campbell are part of Maye’s long term protection plan: the other guys are not, they are stop-gaps who need to be upgraded. 

RT, RG, C/LG still need long term solutions. 

So…don’t trade draft picks.",187986.0,neutral

But a LOT of the sacks he takes are on him, rather than the O-line.  A big part of why his completion percentage is so insane is because he takes sacks instead of throwing the ball out of bounds.  This isn't a massive problem yardage wise, because he almost always scrambles up towards the line and only loses a yard or two, but it's worrying that hes taking so many big shots and could get injured.  My biggest wants if we're trying to go all the way this season are an up the middle D-line star, another threat at RB, and some depth at WR.  It doesn't need to be a star WR, Maye can make it work with these guys, but we need to be able to fill gaps for injury.  I don't want to trade away lots of early picks for expensive players that are in their prime and going to be fading.  We have awesome bones and a lot of young players right now. If we're going to improve for the now on trades, depth and a a big defensive playmaker are the top priorities.",31331.0,positive

I think it's finally time to consider them a Top 5 team in the AFC especially now sitting at #2 with the Colts.  As a pure fan, I'm on cloud 9.  We are going to easily match our win total from the last 2 seasons combined.  Our QB looks like he has the makings of being one of the top performers in the league for a decade and still shows growth potential.  Our coaching is not only competent, but looks like a competitive advantage, and that's with some massive health issues throwing a wrench into the original plan.

Now, taking a more critical look, our defense is very concerning.  We have allowed nearly every QB we've played against besides Josh Allen to have their best game of the season against us.  That's a scary thing to know considering we will likely have to play guys like Mahomes, Herbert, and possibly Lamar in the playoffs if we want to do anything.  On top of that, I think it's fair to say that our offense has been punching above its weight considering how inconsistent the line has played.  I know regression to the mean is a meme at this point, but the rate we are overcoming 3rd and long does not feel sustainable.

I came into this season expecting 7 wins as our ceiling, so I'm really just enjoying the ride.  But I'm really enjoying the fact that I can be critical from the lens of ""what will it take to make a deep playoff run"" and not from the lens of ""what will it take to escape the basement of the league"".

 If you watch the play the only person clapping was the safety 10-15 yards away.. he also was looking away towards the sideline. I don’t believe that would cause the center to snap the ball early with the amount of noise and sounds coming from the stands and sidelines.

 They were not scheme fits. What that means is the base defense we would be running in would play directly against their strengths.

Dugger and Peppers were always more box safeties than coverage safeties. What does that mean in practice ? It means they were better against the run and they usually played closer to the line of scrimmage. 

Their job in most cases wasn’t to cover the deep ball all the time but to stick closer to the middle of the field, be extra coverage in the middle and stick to their zone/area more or less. 

What we are asking our Safeties to do now is to hang out deep or be extra coverage for WR’s on certain plays. The issue is if you aren’t fast or skilled enough the WRs will beat you.

That said, still don't mind moving on. He's looked like he lost a step since that injury a year or two ago, and clearly wasn't fitting in well. Might as well get a small asset, let a more developmental/upside guy play, and get out from a bad contract.

>Dugger is more of a box safety whose ability to play closer to the line of scrimmage was viewed as an asset by Belichick and Mayo, but it isn't a big part of the responsibilities of a safety in Vrabel's scheme, which values those who can play a variety of roles (which is partially why Saunders appealed to them).",2818217.0,negative

There's not really any great answers for that other than Vrabel wanting to gut the roster of old Belichick mainstays in order to turn over a new leaf and put in Vrabels' Guys™ doing Vrabels' Scheme™ or just moving on from older guys to make the roster younger. We saw this with statements like Deatrich Wise and David Andrews being cut before before preseason camp even started. Andrews cut absolutely hurt this team early in the season, as did Peppers.

Scheme-wise the strength of Duggers and Peppers was in 3 safety packages where a linebacker subs out for a safety, where they would be trusted to be as good as a linebacker against the runs while being better than linebackers in coverage (which they absolutely would have been in this roster). They are basically ideal for offenses with genuine dual-threat running backs and tight ends, but they are perfectly functional in deep zones (anyone arguing otherwise doesn't know football; Dugger's coverage issues are primarily in intermediate zone coverages and man coverage, go look at 2022 when he scored multiple Interception TDs off deep  zones). Cutting Peppers nearly cost the patriots the game against Miami due to the Spillane's struggles to tackle and cover Achane, for instance. Furthermore, with both Dugger and Peppers on the field at the same time, you can create more complex coverage disguises to mess with QBs (you can have one, two or three deep zones and zero, one or two box safeties).

However we have seen the patriots defense rally against the run really well since then and hold a lot of good running games to minimal yards, while not being too bad against the pass either. With Vrabels Guys™ at the linebacker position (i.e. Ellis and Spillane) playing well enough in that role, Peppers and Dugger would just be stealing snaps from them if they were being used properly.

But Vrabel absolutely showed zero interest in doing so at any point this season, only allowing Dugger to take snaps in place of another safety who was injured. Having Dugger and Peppers only ever play a traditional safety role is just a poor use of their capabilities. They are much better when their versatility is taken advantage of and used to mess with QBs and OCs.

In short, Vrabel has demonstrated precisely zero interest or inclination in using Dugger and Peppers properly, making the two of them a complete waste of their contract. Admittedly, it isn't exactly a satisfying answer to basically say ""Vrabel screwed the pooch"" (especially for a team that has clearly and objectively improved massively under his leadership); to be fair, you could say that Dugger was never going to play up to his contract even if he was being used properly, whereas cutting Peppers and Andrews basically allowed the patriots to move onto younger guys even if they weren't playing as well for a time without them.",78284.0,negative

 You already hit the nail on the head, that these players weren’t scheme fits. Think about Mike Vrabel the player. Arguably the most versatile player in NFL history. I believe he is the only player that had career 10+ sacks, interceptions, and touchdown receptions. Travis Hunter might join him (if he starts blitzing as a corner) but still Vrabel was a unicorn seeing as he played a position that wasn’t really built on supreme athleticism the way WR/CB does. 

So he was the type of guy that could do it all and as a coach he gravitates towards that style as well. Dugger and Peppers (and other guys that aren’t here anymore like Bentley and White) were very rigid, more old school players. Dugger was an undersized LB / not athletic safety that could not drop back in coverage but lacked QB pressure skills. He was a great physical guy in short yardage and run gap stuffer. Peppers had some serious pop athletically coming out of college but ultimately transformed into a booming over the middle type of guy that again, probably stuff gaps and hits hard more than he can play coverage or effectively blitz. 

What this leaves is a team that has only one way of being able to play, and Vrabel saw this as a bit of a dying build. You need to be more of an amoeba style that can have guys that shift around positions and duties depending on the strength of who you are playing. The Steelers defense is the perfect example of the old style defense that basically does the same thing week in and week out, and only asks players to do one thing each, which is the zone blitz. Peppers and Dugger are solid professionals who can 100% stand out on a team that doesn’t need/ want them to do more than they are good at. What we are building here in New England is something that asks players to be versatile, fluid, and multi dimensional.",58713.0,negative

>Whenever I do anything military-related, I try to be as respectful to the uniform or whatever else is supposed to be a part of it, so I can. And you know I have a brother that's in the Marines, and I think I take that a little more seriously than other outfits that I do. And that's why the shoes went on, because that was a part of their uniform. Shout out to Gene and his father Gene, who actually gave me that uniform. And they wore it during the game, right after.

We started coming back so I was like “keep playing!” and she did. She played so long she was probably hurting lol. She played until we scored the game winner.

So we all owe her a thank you

He came in, had a few missteps, kept his head down and just worked on his game and it's paying dividends.

That TD route he ran last week was a thing of beauty with how he turned that defender inside out. Guys like Boutte, Egbuka etc.... those guys that don't necessarily have burners or crazy immeasurables, but they're smart and they're always studying. 

I also noticed he's getting faster and faster, it seems, every week.

I was 10 when he got his first start. Looking back I realize how fortunate our fan base was to be able to walk into any game with a feeling that we could win. It didn't matter who we were playing, where we were playing, or what injuries our team had. As long as 12 was on the field I always felt like we had a chance to win until the clock hit triple 0's. He was a great role model, always said the right things win or lose, never threw anyone under the bus and always shouldered the blame. It was amazing being able to watch his game evolve over the years from being a ""game manager"" into the greatest quarterback of all time. Even with all that said I still took it for granted. And I miss watching him play on Sundays. He was a massive part of my child, young adult, and adult hood. I wish I could meet him and thank him for the impact he had on me and our fan base.

If Jennings can take advantage of gaps and finish some punishing runs we’ll get our usual play action shots off that & run the normal offense.

","The Patriots are #2 in fewest rush yards/game and #5 in run defense DVOA. They have also not allowed a single RB to run for more than 50 yards.

They’re also trying to repeat, trading their best WR for picks makes no sense as it makes them worse off. 

Offseason trade is more likely if he’s still a malcontent who’s obsessed with his stats. 

As a Pats fan, after hearing everything about this situation, I want no part of AJ Brown. Definitely not for what it will cost to get him either(the talk is a 1st and a 2nd) 

The fact we offered a 2nd tells me that we’re not in love with him either. Good. Dude is a “me me me” guy and wasn’t even that happy after they won the damn Super Bowl by all reports.

Hubbard has just recently come up in talks, with Dowdle being discussed originally. I remember when Hubbard came back, the goal was to split reps and recently I read Hubbard was on board with it.

FWIW, he'd be a great 'get' for a 5th. He's faster than Stevenson, catches about as well (better at routes), a little weaker and a slight *downgrade* at blocking. Given the size similarities, game etc., this would send a message to Rhamondre imo. On paper it looks like a RB3/KR, but I could easily see Hubbard stealing his spot.

Still a huge rumor, though. In fact, the only rumor I believe this week is the one that said we tried to offer a 2nd for A.J. Brown... that's something we'd do lol...",60948.0,negative

Now that we have an elite QB again, can we go back to wearing elite uniforms?  We can dub these blueberries the Mac Jones era uniforms. I think it’s a perfect fit. Hot take, with sliver pants i think I prefer current ones. They might be my favorite flying Elvis unis. I always liked our uniforms during the dynasty but never really loved them. They were just fine for me. Even as a kid i was never a big fan on the pants on the away uniforms, how it was a navy stripe on navy pants, it always felt just a little akward to me.

I love how the stripe pattern on the current set was a call back to the stripes on the shoulders of 80s and 60s pat patriot uniforms. Taking elements of multiple eras of team history. People say it a basic pattern, id say it's a timeless one. It works for a reason. And I think those stripes just pop on TV better. They are a lot more colorful and patriotic. It always bothered me with the dynasty era just how little red was used for a team called the ""Patriots"" and the current unis add a nice splash of it that contrasts well against the dark navy without being overwhelming. I understood the hate when it all navy color rush every week, but the actual jerseys themselves, I never understood why it makes people mad. 

As I said I like the dynasty uniforms but my positive feelings about them have more to do with the winning done in them and nostalgia than the uniforms themselves, which are just ok. The current ones were worn during the worst seasons of the last 30 years so they dont get the same love. I think if Drake continues to succeed they might start to grow on people. I also just like that Bledsoe had his era, Brady had his era, now hopefully this is the start of Drake's. Instead of going back to something, he can carve out his own legacy.",21765.0,positive

Now that we have an elite QB again, can we go back to wearing elite uniforms?  We can dub these blueberries the Mac Jones era uniforms. I think it’s a perfect fit. The current uniforms are easily a bottom 5 uniform in the NFL. So plain, generic. They don't match the helmet because...... they weren't designed together! Shocking. The shoulder stripes are hideous. The road uni's look like 3 completely different uniform parts which makes them look like little kids dressed as football players for halloween.

Whatever people's opinions are of the dynasty uniforms (i like them, love the whites), it was truly unfathomable for an organization to dump a 6 time super bowl kit for a gimmick color rush concept. From a branding perspective it's the dumbest possible decision. It makes no sense. No other team with that amount of success does this. Who asked for this? Whoever was behind this decision should be one billion miles away from the decision making the next time they make decisions on uniforms.

It's an insult to fans. We are the rare team with.... not one.... not two... but three uniform sets that are clearly better than the primaries. The 90's blues would be an epic throwback. EIther the dynasties or the reds would be a clear upgrade over what we currently have. It's a disgrace! 

And whatever they do next.... Please don't just don't let NIKE go full NIKE on us. Every new NFL uniform rollout feels the same now. Players look like oversized crayons. Too many “storytelling details,” like a tiny zigzag in a shoulder stripe that’s supposed to represent the spirit of a city or some bullshit nobody cares about. Minimalism is killing modern uniform design. It’s sterile. Every team ends up looking like a template in a Nike PowerPoint.",21765.0,positive

Mayo, likely still would’ve been here if we would’ve drafted Bo, I think out of the three lowest floor highest ceiling, we would’ve been a better team last year.

He's essentially a basketball player in a football uniform.  The wrist flip is an extension of the jump shot which allows him to be really accurate.  In the jump shot, most of the body mechanics are fixed and everything is controlled with the legs.  It takes out a lot of the variables that can influence a shot.  I think that's what he's doing with the football to a degree.  He's adding arc and touch with his wrist and trying to keep the rest of his mechanics uniform.

People will be there the full four hours before to tailgate in stadium lots and longer in some
Private lots. Pack up as much gear as you can and tailgate away.
You want to be in line at the stadium at least 45 min before kickoff. It’s your first game and you want to be there for the anthem and team walking out. You’ll have to go through security and walk (sometimes far) to your seats. I think 45 min is the bare minimum.

I love reading about players and coaches using their celebrity/platform to do good deeds like this. It's such a good use of their position in their communities and it can do so much good for people who can really use all the breaks and good vibes they can get. And, of course, it never hurts to cultivate some good karma.

Also, does anyone know what illness* the kid has/had? Maybe I missed it somewhere, but all I see mentioned is that he had an illness and then a subsequent miraculous recovery. I'm just curious.

*Editing to add a note: I read in a different article that the kid was suffering from complications created by sickle cell disease. Amongst other issues, his lung tissue and function was greatly affected and the miraculous recovery was due to some experimental gene therapy that helped heal much of the damage.

Marcus Jones, Houston Size: 5-8, 185

The Good: Ultra-speedy and unbelievably quick, he’s a baller who’ll never lose his guy. There are plenty of fast corners in this draft who can hang with the bigger receivers, but Jones is among the best at mirroring what the ultra-athletic ones can do. Don’t get too lost in his size – he can tackle with over 150 stops in his four years. But …

The Not-So-Good: Can he hold up? He’ll go and pop anyone, but he had shoulder problems and missed parts of the offseason process. Again, he’ll hit, but he’ll get erased by every blocker and he’s not quite physical enough for all that effort.

NFL Draft College Perspective Thought: He started out his career at Troy before moving over the Houston. Now he’s an interesting jack-of-all-trades call with his speed at corner, elite upside as a returner, and possibilities as a receiver and offensive weapon. Every coaching staff will want the entire package after the second round.

Given how little opportunity he got, I am surprised that his stock would have fallen that low. Anyone know what he is up to and why hasn't resurfaced somewhere? He's getting paid so he doesn't care.  Best case. he'll end up with an assistant DC job next.  It was always unclear exactly what he did on D before Kraft gifted him the HC job after the epiphany in the Holy Land.  Plus nothing Mayo did as HC increased his stock.",232650.0,

","Drake Maye currently has the 3rd highest CPOE (Completion Percentage Over Expected) across the first eight weeks in recorded history. The only two players above him are 2013 Phillip Rivers and 2007 Tom Brady. Additional fun fact: per PFF, Drake Maye has a perfect 158.3 passer rating on deep (20+ air yard) throws in eight weeks. Don't think that's ever happened. It’s an interesting chart but Gino Smith, Kyler Murray, and Teddy Bridgewater being on the chart makes it seem a bit less elite.  

It’s also telling how many of those are from recent seasons.   Gives you an idea of just how dominant the 2007 Pats really were.",303594.0,
