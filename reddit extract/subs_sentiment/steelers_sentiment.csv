Seeing that graphic with every analyst taking the Bears just makes this matchup more fun. Underdog Steelers are my favorite version of this team. All the talk goes to Chicago, all the pressure sits on the home sideline, and the Steelers get to walk in as the side that is not supposed to win.

Also, it feels pretty good riding a high from whooping the bungals last week. The Steelers just turned a division rival into a confidence boost, and now step into Soldier Field with nothing to lose and everything to ruin for the Bears.

If the experts are right, so be it. But if this turns into one of those ugly, grind-it-out games where every mistake gets magnified, that underdog energy can flip the whole script in a hurry. Let's ride. 🖤💛

But one thing that was obvious, and that several people have pointed out, was the difference in in the pocket. Rodgers has been skittery the last few weeks. I think that skittery behavior has made the offensive line confused about where exactly they should be planting themselves as the pressure is coming, and who they should prioritize blocking.

  
Rodgers was sacked once, and knocked down 4 other times. Rudolph didn't get touched ONCE in the second half. The protection was excellent, and I think it's because the offensive line always knew where he was going to be.

  
Now,  think that this comes with its own flaws. Being a statue isn't the greatest thing. But perhaps some of our recent offensive line woes had more to do with Rodgers being a little more worried about being hit (understandably), leading to all the things we saw in the first half. 

  
The Bengals pass rush is absolutely abysmal, that's how it should have looked the whole game. But if our line looks more like that with Rudolph under center, we will get more production out of the offense.",45169.0,neutral

Pierre was great today and built off his last performance. He was physical, provided run support that we were missing from CBs, and is a good communicator. Also, great fumble recovery for a TD.

JPJ had a great day. He covered Chase for a lot of the game and held him to very few yards. This was possibly Chase’s worst game this year and JPJ was with him for a lot of it jawing at him.

Echols was solid for most of the game and had his forced fumble at the end of the game, so another great performance from him. He wasn't that noticeable for most of the game, which is good, so I don't have much else to say.

Dugger was good, but especially important with his pick 6. He also broke up a pass in the form of a dropped INT, so he could’ve had 2 today.

Ramsey was also solid today even though he got ejected. Kind of silly since he was probably more in Chase’s head than the other way around. Anyway, he seems much more fit to play safety and has brought the physicality necessary to do so.

The Steelers played 4 first place teams (pack just slipping back after monday), and the Chargers who are just 1 game back in the West.  Thats 3 of the 4 losses, with one being to Seattle pretty much entirely on a special teams blunder.

The Bears are now in 1st place so that game looks tougher, we still got the Bills and Lions who will both be hard games.  In addition to 2 fist fight in the parking lots against the Ravens.  In addition the Bengals despite not racking up wins are still racking up shit tons of offense and would be looking a lot better if not for two 4th quarter collapses of their own.

For me this is a bit ballyhoo that the team may be a bit oversold right now.  The loss to Seattle was very close, beating the top 2 teams in the AFC right now in the Pats and Colts can't be overstated, and currently the strategy of just being very conservative with the ball security kicked the Packers out of first place and I'd say is part of the reason the game stayed so close vs the Chargers.

Can't ask for more of a get-right game for the offense than the Bengals defense, but gonna have to figure out their quick pass game on defense of course.

The 2020 bucs were 7-5 in Week 12 after losing 2 in a Row to the Rams and Chiefs (both top teams at the time).  Then they went on a 4 win streak to enter the playoffs and catch absolute fire with their dominant defense.

In my mind, there is 1 team happy at the end of the season and 31 teams disappointed. If you truly dont have a shot to be 1 of those top 4 teams who make to the championship games, then you really are on the same level with the other 28 teams.

You may call me a bootlicker, or a sunshine and rainbows guy, but I view every season since post-Ben as a rebuilding year. Since Khan, we've upgraded our Oline and Dline every year. Nearly every pick has had playing time, and are still young enough that they haven't reached their ceiling yet. Our team is rebuilding.

Now what's truly frustrating is that we dont ever have a top 10 pick.

We overperform every year, take our 20th draft pick, and accept that we will have at best the 3rd best QB. Which hasn't been worth a shit since Ben retired. If you go back and look at every year since 2020, the only guys we reasonably could have gotten that would have improved our situation would be Lamar Jackson, Jordan Love (Minkah year), & Jalen Hurts. All 3 were drafted before Khan, and since Khan has taken over, there has not been a QB draft class worth a damn except for 2024. In which case, would we have really wanted to trade the farm for Michael Penix? Bo Nix? JJ McCarthy? The only chance we got the top 3 QBs that year were if we were somehow worse than the Panthers, Commanders, and Patriots, because none of them were trading that pick.

All of this is to say, we are in this position sincerely due to bad QB draft classes and overperformance. I believe that, when it comes down to draft time every year, Khan will try to trade up for a qb IF there is a Mahomes, Jalen Hurts, Lamar, etc. in the draft. But there truly hasn't been any QB worth that (I was NOT high on Dart at all, his performance has truly been a surprise to me and I'd like to say to most draft analysis as he came from a very watered down system in college).

And looping back to the first section, im kind of glad we didnt keep Pickens or trade for a receiver. That truly wouldn't have put this team into top 4 talks, and it would have just taken away from our draft capital and made our picks worse.

So RELAX. We are rebuilding. There is no team in the NFL that can compete without a franchise QB (or an actual superteam). The only difference between the rebuilding teams and us is that we overperform. We make small moves to sell more tickets, to keep more fans engaged. Because its not the ""steeler"" way to cut losses. We will always be successful, but never win anything big until we have a QB who isn't scraps coming to their 3rd team.",17220.0,negative

1otdjrt,1762780811.0,550,0.82,536,,"What will it take for Tomlin defenders? Is he simply untouchable? For those of you who still strongly defend him — what would it realistically take for you to say, “Yeah, it’s time”?
 
I’m not asking this as some knee-jerk “fire everyone” fan. I’m asking because it feels like we’ve been living the same season on repeat for years now. No matter who the DC is, who the OC is, who the QB is, who the WRs are… we always end up in the same place: around 9–8 and, at best, a first-round playoff exit. At some point you can’t keep blaming the players or the coordinators when the results don’t actually change. There’s one constant.
 
League stability and average relevance is a constant defense I have seen. I would argue this is the worst purgatory possible. 

I do think Tomlin brings real value. The leadership, the stability, the respect he has around the league — I get all of that. We always hear about how players “want to play for Tomlin” and how that supposedly makes Pittsburgh this great free agency destination. But honestly, how true is that anymore? We’ve also seen plenty of guys not want to come here, including this past trade deadline. That supposed “Tomlin effect” feels pretty exaggerated at this point.
 
What frustrates me is that there seem to be obvious changes that could be made, but we just… don’t. It’s Tomlin’s way or the highway, and the organization seems totally content to ride this same story out indefinitely.
 
So my question is: is Tomlin basically untouchable until 2027? If he lost every game from now until his contract is up, do we really believe the team would move on? Or is the combination of his early-career success and the “Steelers don’t fire coaches” principle going to keep him locked in no matter what?

Yes, the Chargers defense did a great job of anticipating him stepping up into the pocket and then dropping him.  But he has enough experience that maybe he should have stopped doing that.

It was an ugly game overall.  But this game was his worst performance as a Steeler.  And I really feel like the loss is on him.

Edit to add:  Why was he even playing late in the fourth quarter when the game was out of hand?  He took more sacks and could have been injured.  If you want to roll with the guy, cool.  But when it's just garbage time, put in Mason to take those lumps, not your starter.

Given the jakobi meyers trade was only a 4th and a 6th, and I also want to remind everyone how valuable our draft picks have been lately with Omar Khan and Andy Weidl.

Keep in mind, a draft pick is guaranteed to play at least 4 years on a very low cap hit.

2023  
We had a great draft  
1st round - starting tackle jones  
2nd round - starting corner JPJ and dline benton.

The real value comes from   
3rd round Darnell Washington.  
4th round Nick Herbig.  
7th round Cory Trice (injured) but also Spencer Anderson (our favorite reporting as eligible lineman)

2024  
Solid draft again  
1st round - starting tackle fautanu  
2nd round - starting center frazier  
3rd round - WR wilson (fuck that hurdle)  
late 3rd round - LB Payton Wilson (colt's game GOAT)  
4th round - starting guard mccormick

2025  
great draft again  
1st round - starting DT harmon (the beast in the middle)  
3rd round - RB johnson (learn the kickoff rules...)  
4th round - OLB sawyer  
5th round - DE black  
6th round - QB howard (we'll see if this pans out)

So looking at all these draft picks, our draft picks have hit way more often than not, and it would be dumb to trade a ton of draft capital away for a WR we aren't going to be able to keep beyond this year.

I watched a 3 and out, Indy TD, another 3 and out.  I turned the game off to play some Diablo IV.  I'd rather kill demons than watch the team flounder.  An hour or so later, it's the Steelers up 24-7 and I turn the game back on.  Before I know it, the Colts make it 27-17 and Roman Wilson fumbles after thinking he was an Olympic high jumper.  I turn the game off again.  I figured they would eek out a win or I would watch a collapse.  Either way, I didn't want to deal with the frustration.  I found out that a few plays later JPJ got his 1st interception helping to prevent the Colts comeback.

My conclusion?  They suck when I watch and ball out when I don't.  So going forward, I will no longer watch them live.  I'll take one for the team for the rest of the season.  ",7672.0,negative

Best rookie: Derrick Harmon. Injury aside, he’s been solid on an otherwise lackluster draft class. The future of the D-line could be bright if he continues to develop both conditioning and technique wise. ",7697.0,positive

I like him and can appreciate the longstanding stability he provides. The Steelers have remained stagnant for far too long though. It’s been many years of average play and the organization should be striving for more. 

It’s time for a fresh start. Teryl Austin needs to go as well. The defense is either overpaid or he’s the problem; or both. 

When the Steelers do finally move on from Tomlin, the possibility of someone worse replacing him obviously exists. The worst that can happen is that we are bad for some time and stockpile high draft picks. I don’t necessarily believe Tomlin’s successor will be an immediate improvement; although that could end up being the case. I’m at peace with a temporary downgrade if that means we won’t be stuck in this purgatory of mediocrity. 

How many more years should we accept the same stale mistakes and outcomes? It’s time for a change, because the Steelers haven’t won a playoff game in 8 years and I have no confidence that this trend will shift.

Ya'll can sit and blame TJ, Cam, Rodgers, DK whoever. But none of these people are the problem. It is generally no single player's fault for a loss. TJ handed us wins the past couple of years but this is a fucking team sport and single players securing games is an anomaly that shouldn't be depended on. Place Prime 2021 TJ Watt in this game and it still ends up the same. What did Helmet Beater's 5 sacks get the Browns? The same L we're about to take. I'm fucking sick of people putting an entire implosion on one fucking player.

This is an abject failure of coaching and scheme and preparedness.

I could've told you Tucker Kraft would wreck this game. I would have bet all of my rent money on it if I wasn't morally opposed to betting against the Steelers.

I could've told you their running game would wreck this game. Why the fuck can't our coaching staff see that? Why the fuck is it year after year of teams saying our plans are simple? Why the fuck is it year after year of well coached teams figuring us out like a book.

Arthur Smith's effect on the offense has been evident. It hasn't always been great. But this is more or less the best offense I've seen us have since Ben. The defense. My fucking god man. Everyone since Dick Lebeau has been a pile of steaming dogshit. Everyone under Tomlin has been a steaming pile of dogshit.

1oaxr3i,1760899985.0,284,0.96,102,,"This is a summary of what the film guys are saying about the Steelers Defense This is just my amateur opinion of what I’ve gathered from the film guys:

- Darius slay is washed, especially in man coverage. He needs to be benched.

- Jalen Ramsey isn’t explosive enough anymore to be an outside corner, but is very effective in the slot / safety

- Echols has been the best man CB and graded CB and he should start over slay on the outside 

- chuck clark is easily the worst player on this defense and is a big reason for the Steelers defensive woes. He’s the main reason for the bad run D on Thursday and poor tackling. Keeps trying to shoot gaps and is out of position.

- for some reason, Chuck Clark went from virtually no snaps against Clevelan to being the starting safety against the bengals and playing every snap. It’s bizarre.

- thornhill should be starting over chuck Clark and did AGI and Minnesota and Cleveland. Again o reason why they changed this for the bengals. 

- DL has been elite, but herbig isn’t getting enough snaps. He’s clearly better than highsmith but highsmith is splitting snaps with him now.

* Tomlin has an insanely good 21-3-0 record on Monday Night, matched only by John Madden (11-1-1).  No one else is even close.
* Tomlin has an equally insanely bad 2-10-0 record on Thursday Night road games.
* But it's only the road games: Tomlin is a pretty good 9-2-0 at home on Thursday.
* Tomlin's winning percentage at home? .701, almost identical to Cowher (.703) and Noll (.702).
* I can't find up-to-date stats on it, but according to this 2017 article, [Tomlin's away record in the Eastern Time Zone](https://steelcityblitz.com/that-time-zone-thing-2017-edition/) is much, much better than Cowher and Noll (.638, .595, .409).

Diagnosis (not a doctor): Tomlin has Circadian Rhythm Disorder.  Like [Ryan Clark trying to play in Denver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMM_S-Eccg0), Tomlin transforms from a genius into a quivering mess because of pure biology.  It's not that he WANTS to make terrible 4th down decisions, or WANTS to not cover Jamarr Chase.  Tomlin is just a sleepy lil' guy, and he CAN'T manage a game when he's tired.

Solution: Tomlin stays Head Coach, but only for games when he's feeling well rested.  When he gets sleepy, we bring in Coach [Micah Parsons, who apparently can fall asleep anywhere](https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/breaking-news/article/micah-parsons-seen-napping-on-trainers-table-during-cowboys-preseason-game-after-inviting-trade-call-in-the-tunnel-225057262.html).",48857.0,neutral
